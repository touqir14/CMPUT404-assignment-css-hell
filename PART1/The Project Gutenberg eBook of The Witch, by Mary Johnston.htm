<p class="pc4 xlarge"><b>THE WITCH</b></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">THE QUEEN’S CHAMBER</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was said that the Queen was dying. She lay
at Richmond, in the palace looking out upon the
wintry, wooded, March-shaken park, but London, a
few miles away, had daily news of how she did.
There was much talk about her—the old Queen—much
telling of stories and harking back. She had
had a long reign—“Not far from fifty years, my
masters!”—and in it many important things had
happened. The crowd in the streets, the barge and
wherry folk upon the wind-ruffled river, the roisterers
in the taverns drinking ale or sack, merchants
and citizens in general talking of the times in the
intervals of business, old soldiers and seamen ashore,
all manner of folk, indeed, agreed upon the one most
important thing. The most important thing had
been the scattering of the Armada fifteen years
before. That disposed of, opinions differed as to the
next most important. The old soldiers were for
all fighting wherever it had occurred. The seamen
and returned adventurers threw for the voyages of
Drake and Frobisher and Gilbert and Raleigh. With
these were inclined to agree the great merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and guild-masters who were venturing in the East
India and other joint-stock companies. The little
merchant and guild fellows agreed with the great.
A very large number of all classes claimed for the
overthrow of Popery the first place. On the other
hand, a considerable number either a little hurriedly
slurred this, or else somewhat too anxiously and
earnestly supported the assertion. One circle, all
churchmen, lauded the Act of Uniformity, and the
pains and penalties provided alike for Popish recusant
and non-conforming Protestant. Another circle,
men of a serious cast of countenance and of a
growing simplicity in dress, left the Act of Uniformity
in obscurity, and after the deliverance from the
Pope, made the important happening the support
given the Protestant principle in France and the
Netherlands. A few extreme loyalists put in a claim
for the number of conspiracies unearthed and trampled
into nothingness—Scottish conspiracies, Irish
conspiracies, Spanish conspiracies, Westmoreland
and Northumberland conspiracies, Throgmorton
conspiracies—the death of the Queen of Scots, the
death, two years ago, of Essex.</p>

<p>All agreed that the Queen had had a stirring reign—all
but the latter end of it. The last few years—despite
Irish affairs—had been dull and settled,
a kind of ditch-water stagnation, a kind of going
downhill. Fifty years, almost, was a long time for
one person to reign....</p>

<p>On a time the Queen had been an idol and a cynosure—for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
years the love of a people had been warm
about her. It had been a people struggling to become
a nation, beset with foreign foes and inner dissensions,
battling for a part in new worlds and
realms. She had led the people well, ruled well, come
out with them into the Promised Land. And now
there was a very human dissatisfaction with the Promised
Land, for the streams did not run milk and
honey nor were the sands golden. As humanly, the
dissatisfaction involved the old Queen. She could
not have been, after all, the Queen that they had
thought her.... After crying for so many years
“Long live Queen Elizabeth!” there would come
creeping into mind a desire for novelty. <i>King James,—King
James!</i> The words sounded well, and promised,
perhaps, the true Golden Age. But they were
said, of course, under breath. The Queen was not
dead yet.</p>

<p>They told strange stories of her—the old Queen;
usually in small, select companies where there were
none but safe men. As March roared on, there was
more and more of this story-telling, straws that
showed the way the tide was setting. They were
rarely now stories of her youth, of her courage and
fire, of her learning, of the danger in which she lived
when she was only “Madam Elizabeth,” of her imprisonment
in the Tower—nor were they stories of
her coronation, and of the way, through so many
long years, she had queened it, of her “mere Englishness,”
her steady courage, her power of work, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
councillors, her wars, and her statecraft. Leaving
that plane, they were not so often either stories of
tragic errors, of wrath and jealousy, finesse and deception,
of arbitrary power, of the fret and weakness
of the strong.—But to-day they told stories of her
amours, real or pretended. They repeated what she
had said to Leicester and Leicester had said to her,
what she had said to Alençon and Alençon had
answered. They dug up again with a greasy mind
her girlhood relations with Seymour, they created
lovers for her and puffed every coquetry into a full-blown
<i>liaison</i>; here they made her this man’s mistress
and that man’s mistress, and there they said that she
could be no man’s mistress. They had stories to tell
of her even now, old and sick as she was. They told
how, this winter, for all she was so ill at ease, she
would be dressed each day in stiff and gorgeous
raiment, would lie upon her pillows so, with rings
upon her fingers and her face painted, and when
a young man entered the room, how she gathered
strength....</p>

<p>The March wind roared down the streets and
shook the tavern signs.</p>

<p>In the palace at Richmond, there was a great
room, and in the room there was a great bed. The
room had rich hangings, repeated about the bed.
The windows looked upon the wintry park, and
under a huge, marble mantelpiece, carved with tritons
and wreaths of flowers, a fire burned. About
the room were standing women—maids of honour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
tiring-women. Near the fire stood a group of men,
silent, in attendance.</p>

<p>The Queen did not lie upon the bed—now she
said that she could not endure it, and now she said
that it was her will to lie upon the floor. They
placed rich cushions and she lay among them at their
feet, her gaunt frame stretched upon cloth of gold
and coloured silk. She had upon her a long, rich
gown, as full and rigid a thing as it was possible to
wear and yet recline. Her head was dressed with a
tire of false hair, a mass of red-gold; there was false
colour upon her cheek and lip. She kept a cup of
gold beside her filled with wine and water which at
long intervals she put to her lips. Now she lay for
hours very still, with contracted brows, and now she
turned from side to side, seeking ease and finding
none. Now there came a moan, and now a Tudor
oath. For the most part she lay still, only the fingers
of one hand moving upon the rim of the cup or measuring
the cloth of gold beneath her. Her sight was
failing. She had not eaten, would not eat. She lay
still, supported upon fringed cushions, and the fire
burned with a low sound, and the March wind shook
the windows.</p>

<p>From the group of men by the fire stepped softly,
not her customary physician, but another of some
note, called into association during these last days.
He crossed the floor with a velvet step and stood
beside the Queen. His body bent itself into a curve
of deference, but his eyes searched without reverence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
She could not see him, he knew, with any
clearness. He was followed from the group by a
grave and able councillor. The two stood without
speaking, looking down. The Queen lay with closed
eyes. Her fingers continued to stroke the cloth of
gold; from her thin, drawn lips, coloured cherry-red,
came a halting murmur: “<i>England—Scotland—Ireland—</i>”</p>

<p>The two men glanced at each other, then the
Queen’s councillor, stepping back to the fire, spoke
to a young man standing a little apart from the main
group. This man, too, crossed the floor with a noiseless
step and stood beside the physician. His eyes
likewise searched with a grave, professional interest.</p>

<p>“<i>Navarre</i>,” went the low murmur at their feet.
“<i>Navarre and Orange.... No Pope, but I will have
ritual still.... England—Scotland—</i>”</p>

<p>The Queen moaned and moved her body upon the
cushions. She opened her eyes. “Who’s standing
there? God’s death—!”</p>

<p>The physician knelt. “Madam, it is your poor
physician. Will not Your Grace take the draught
now?”</p>

<p>“No.—There’s some one else—”</p>

<p>“Your Grace, it is a young physician—English—but
who has studied at Paris under the best
scholar of Ambroise Paré. He is learned and skilful.
He came commended by the Duke of —— to Sir
Robert Cecil—”</p>

<p>“God’s wounds!” cried the Queen in a thin, imperious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
voice. “Have I not told you and Cecil, too,
that there was no medicine and no doctor who could
do me good! Paré died, did he not? and you and
your fellow will die! All die. I have seen a many men
and matters die—and I will die, too, if it be my
will!”</p>

<p>She stared past him at the strange physician. “If
he were Hippocrates himself I would not have him!
I do not like his looks. He is a dreamer and born to
be hanged.—Begone, both of you, and leave me at
peace.”</p>

<p>Her eyes closed. She turned upon the cushions.
Her fingers began again to move upon the rich stuff
beneath her. “<i>England</i>—”</p>

<p>The rejected aid or attempt to aid stepped, velvet-footed,
backward from the pallet. The physicians
knew, and all in the room knew, that the Queen
could not now really envisage a new face. She might
with equal knowledge have said of the man from
Paris, “He is a prince in disguise and born to be
crowned.” But though they knew this to be true,
the Queen had said the one thing and had not said
the other, and what she said had still great and
authoritative weight of suggestion. The younger
physician, returning to his place a little apart alike
from the women attendants and from the group of
courtiers, became the recipient of glances of predetermined
curiosity and misliking. Now, as it happened,
he really did have something the look of a
dreamer—thin, pale, and thoughtful-faced, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
musing, questioning eyes. While according to accepted
canons it was not handsome, while, indeed,
it was somewhat strange, mobile, and elf-like, his
countenance was in reality not at all unpleasing. It
showed kindliness no less than power to think. But
it was a face that was not usual.... He was fairly
young, tall and well-formed though exceedingly
spare, well dressed after the quiet and sober fashion
of his calling. Of their own accord, passing him
hastily in corridor or street, the people in the room
might not have given him a thought. But now they
saw that undoubtedly he <i>was</i> strange, perhaps even
sinister of aspect. Each wished to be as perspicacious
as the Queen.</p>

<p>But they did not think much about it, and as the
newcomer, after a reverence directed toward the
Queen, presently withdrew with the older physician,—who
came gliding back without him,—and as he
was seen no more in the palace, they soon ceased to
think about him at all. He had been recommended
by a great French lord to the favour of Sir Robert
Cecil. The latter, sending for him within a day or
two, told him bluntly that he did not seem fitted for
the Court nor for Court promotion.</p>

<p>The March wind roared through London and over
Merry England and around Richmond park and hill.
It shook the palace windows. Within, in the great
room with the great bed, the old Queen lay upon the
floor with pillows beneath her, with her brows drawn
together above her hawk nose. At intervals her mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
disease and lack of all comfort wrung a moan, or
she gave one of her old, impatient, round, mouth-filling
oaths. For the most part she lay quite silent,
uneating, unsleeping, her fleshless fingers keeping
time against the rich cloth beneath her. Her women
did not love her as the women of Mary Stuart had
loved that Queen. Year in and year out, day in and
day out, they had feared this Queen; now she was
almost past fearing. They took no care to tell her
that the carmine upon her face was not right, or that
she had pushed the attire of hair to one side, and
that her own hair showed beneath and was grey.
They reasoned, perhaps with truth, that she might
strike the one who told. She lay in her rich garments
upon the floor, and the fire burned with a
low sound beneath the wreathed tritons and she
smoothed the gold cloth with her fingers. “<i>England—Scotland—Ireland....
Mere English—... The
Pope down, but I’ll have the Bishops still—</i>”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CAP AND BELLS</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">The</span> inn was small and snug, near Cheapside Cross,
and resorted to by men of an argumentative mind.
The Mermaid Tavern, no great distance away, had
its poets and players, but the Cap and Bells was for
statesmen in their own thought alone, and for disputants
upon such trifles as the condition of Europe,
the Pope, and the change in the world wrought by
Doctor Martin Luther. It was ill-luck, certainly,
that brought Gilbert Aderhold to such a place.</p>

<p>When he lost hope of any help from Cecil, the evident
first thing to do upon returning from Richmond
to London, was to change to lodgings that were less
dear,—indeed, to lodgings as little dear as possible.
His purse was running very low. He changed, with
promptitude, to a poor room in a poor house. It was
cold at night and dreary, and his eyes, tired with
reading through much of the day, ached in the one
candlelight. He went out into the dark and windy
street, saw the glow from the windows and open
door of the Cap and Bells, and trimmed his course
for the swinging sign, a draught of malmsey and
jovial human faces.</p>

<p>In the tavern’s common room he found a seat
upon the long bench that ran around the wall. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was a desirable corner seat and it became his only by
virtue of its former occupant, a portly goldsmith,
being taken with a sudden dizziness, rising and
leaving the place. Aderhold, chancing to be standing
within three feet, slipped into the corner. He was
near the fire and it warmed him gratefully. A
drawer passing, he ordered the malmsey, and when
it was brought he rested the cup upon the table
before him. It was a long table, and toward the
farther end sat half a dozen men, drinking and talking.
What with firelight and candles the room was
bright enough. It was warm, and at the moment of
Aderhold’s entrance, peaceable. He thought of a
round of wild and noisy taverns that he had tried
one after the other, and, looking around him, experienced
a glow of self-congratulation. He wanted
peace, he wanted quiet; he had no love for the sudden
brawls, for the candles knocked out, and lives
of peaceable men in danger that characterized the
most of such resorts. He sipped his wine, and after
a few minutes of looking about and finding that the
cluster at the far end of the table was upon a discussion
of matters which did not interest him, he
drew from his breast the book he had been reading
and fell to it again. As he read always with a concentrated
attention, he was presently oblivious of all
around.</p>

<p>An arm in a puffed sleeve of blue cloth slashed
with red, coming flat against the book and smothering
the page from sight, broke the spell and brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
him back to the Cap and Bells. He raised his chin
from his hand and his eyes from the book—or
rather from the blue sleeve. The wearer of this, a
formidable, large man, an evident bully, with a captious
and rubicund face, frowned upon him from
the seat he had taken, at the foot of the table, just
by his corner. The number of drinkers and conversers
had greatly increased. There was not now just
a handful at this especial table; they were a dozen
or more. Moreover, he found that for some reason
their attention was upon him; they were watching
him; and he had a great and nervous dislike of
being watched. He became aware that there was a
good deal of noise, coarse jests and laughter, and
some disputing. Yet they looked, for the most part,
substantial men, not the wild Trojans and slashswords
that he sometimes encountered. For all his
physical trepidations he was a close and accurate
observer; roused now, he sent a couple of rapid
glances the length and breadth of the table. They
reported disputatious merchants and burgomasters,
a wine-flushed three or four from the neighbouring
congeries of lawyers, a country esquire, some one
who looked pompous and authoritative like a petty
magistrate, others less patent,—and the owner of
the arm still insolently stretched across his book.</p>

<p>The latter now removed the arm. “So ho! Master
Scholar, your Condescension returns from the moon—after
we’ve halloaed ourselves hoarse! What
devil of a book carried you aloft like that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Aderhold decided to be as placating as possible.
“It is, sir, the ‘Chirurgia Magna’ of Theophrastus
Bombast von Hohenheim, called Paracelsus.”</p>

<p>The red and blue man was determined to bully.
“The Cap and Bells has under consideration the
state of the Realm. The Cap and Bells has addressed
itself to you three times, requesting your
opinion upon grave matters. First you deign no
answer at all, and finally you insult us with trivialities!
’S death! are you an Englishman, sir?”</p>

<p>“As English as you, sir,” answered Aderhold;
“though, in truth, seeing that I have lived abroad
some years and am but lately returned, my English
manners may have somewhat rusted and become
clownish. I crave pardon of the worshipful company,
and I shall not again read in its presence.”</p>

<p>A roisterer addressed him from halfway down the
table. “We’ve got a ruling—we that frequent the
Cap and Bells. You’re a stranger—and a strange-looking
stranger, too, by your leave—and you
must wipe out the offense of your outlandishness!
A bowl of sack for the company—you’ll pay for a
bowl of sack for the company?”</p>

<p>The colour flooded Aderhold’s thin cheek. He had
not enough in his purse or anything like enough.
To-morrow he expected—or hoped rather than expected—to
receive payment from the alderman
whose wife, having fallen ill before the very door
of the house where he lodged, he had attended and
brought out from the presence of death. But to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was to-morrow, and to-night was to-night.
He told the truth. “I am a poor physician, my
masters, who hath of late been set about with misfortune—”</p>

<p>The red and blue bully smote the table with his
fist.</p>

<p>“What a murrain is a man doing in the Cap and
Bells who cannot pay for sack? Poor physician,
quotha! I’ve known a many physicians, but none so
poor as that—”</p>

<p>One of the lawyers, a middle-aged, wiry man in
black, raised his head. “He says true. Come,
brother, out with thy gold and silver!”</p>

<p>“When I shall have paid,” said Aderhold, “for the
malmsey I have drunk, I shall not have fourpence in
my purse.”</p>

<p>“Pay for the sack,” said the lawyer, “and leave
the malmsey go.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Aderhold, “I owe for the malmsey.”</p>

<p>The red and blue man burst forth again. “Oons!
Would you have it that you do not owe the sack?
Call for the drink and a great bowl of it, aye! If the
host is out at the end, he can take his pay with a
cudgel or summon the watch! Physician, quotha?
Now, as my name’s Anthony Mull, he looks more to
me like a black seminary priest!”</p>

<p>Aderhold leaned back appalled. He wished himself
in the windy street or the gloom of his lodgings,
or anywhere but here. Was it all to begin again, the
great weariness of trouble here and trouble there?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
To thread and dodge and bend aside, only in the end
to find himself at bay, bright-eyed and fierce at last
like any hunted animal—he who wanted only peace
and quiet, calm space to think in! He groaned inwardly.
“Ah, the most unlucky star!” There came
to his help, somewhat strangely, and, though none
noticed it, upon the start as it were of the red and
blue bully’s closing words, the Inns of Court man
who had spoken before. He took his arms from the
table and, turning, called aloud, “William Host!
William Host!”</p>

<p>The host came—a stout man with a moon face.
“Aye, sir? aye, Master Carnock?”</p>

<p>“William Host,” said Carnock, “it is known, even
in that remnant of Bœotia, the Mermaid Tavern,
that thou ’rt the greatest lover of books of all the
Queen’s subjects—”</p>

<p>The host assumed the look of the foolish-wise.
“Nay, nay, I would not say the greatest, Master
Carnock! But ’tis known that I value a book—”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the other, “here is a learned doctor
with a no less learned book.” Rising, he leaned halfway
over the table and lifted from before Aderhold
the volume with which he had been engaged. “Lo!
A good-sized book and well made and clothed! Look
you, now! Is’t worth thy greatest bowl of sack, hot
and sugared? It is—I see it by thine eye of judicious
appraisement! I applaud thy judgement!—I
call it a Solomon’s judgement.—Furnish the doctor
with the sack and take the book for payment!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Aderhold thrust out a long and eager arm. “Nay,
sir! I value the book greatly—”</p>

<p>“If you are not a fool—” said the lawyer with
asperity.</p>

<p>But the physician had already drawn back his
arm. He could be at times what the world might
call a fool, but his intelligence agreed that this occasion
did not warrant folly. He might somehow come
up with the book again; if the alderman paid, he
might, indeed, come back to-morrow to the Cap and
Bells and recover it from the host. When the first
starting and shrinking from danger was over, he was
quick and subtle enough in moves of extrication.
He had learned that in his case, or soon or late, a
certain desperate coolness might be expected to appear.
Sometimes he found it at one corner, sometimes
at another; sometimes it only came after long
delay, after long agony and trembling; and sometimes
it slipped its hand into his immediately after
the first recoil. Whenever it came it brought, to his
great relief, an inner detachment, much as though
he were a spectator, very safe in some gallery above.
Up there, so safe and cool, he could even see the
humour in all things. Now he addressed the company.
“My masters, Cleopatra, when she would
have a costly drink, melted pearls in wine! The book
there may be called a jewel, for I prized it mightily.
Will you swallow it dissolved in sack? So I shall
make amends, and all will be wiser for having drunk
understanding!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea appealed, the sack was ordered. But the
red and blue bully was bully still. Aderhold would
have sat quiet in his corner, awaiting the steaming
stuff and planning to slip away as soon as might be
after its coming. At the other end of the table had
arisen a wordy war over some current city matter or
other—so far as he was concerned the company
might seem to be placated and attention drawn. He
was conscious that the lawyer still watched him
from the corner of his eye, but the rest of the dozen
indulged in their own wiseacre wrangling. All, that
is, but the red and blue bully. He still stared and
swelled with animosity, and presently broke forth
again. “‘Physician’! It may be so, but I do not
believe it! As my name’s Anthony Mull, I believe
you to be a Jesuit spy—”</p>

<p>The sack came at the moment and with it a diversion.
Cups were filled, all drank, and the lawyer
flung upon the board for discussion the growing use
of tobacco, its merits and demerits. Then, with
suddenness, the petty magistrate at the head of the
table was found to be relating the pillorying that
day, side by side, of a Popish recusant and a railing
Banbury man or Puritan. All at table turned out to
be strong Church of England men, zealous maintainers
of the Act of Uniformity, jealous of even a smack
of deviation toward Pope or Calvin. At the close of
a moment of suspension, while all drank again, the
red and blue bully, leaning forward, addressed the
man of justice. “Good Master Pierce, regard this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
leech, so named, and put the question to him, will
he curse Popery and all its works.”</p>

<p>It seemed, in truth, that this was Aderhold’s
unlucky night. That, or there was something in
the Queen’s declaration, there was something about
him different, something that provoked in all these
people antagonism. And yet he was a quiet man, of
a behaviour so careful that it suggested a shyness or
timidity beyond the ordinary. He was not ill-looking
or villainous-looking—but yet, there it was!
For all that he was indubitably of English birth,
“<i>Foreigner</i>” was written upon him.</p>

<p>The present unluckiness was the being again
involved in this contentious and noisy hour. He had
been gathering himself together, meaning to rise
with the emptying of the bowl, make his bow to the
company, and quit the Cap and Bells. And now it
seemed that he must stop to assure them that he was
not of the old religion! Aderhold’s inner man might
have faintly smiled. He felt the lawyer’s gaze upon
him—a curious, even an apprehensive, gaze. The
justice put the question portentously, all the table,
save only the lawyer, leaning forward, gloating for
the answer, ready to dart a claw forward at the least
flinching. But Aderhold spoke soberly, with a quiet
brow. “I do not hold with cursing, Master Justice.
It is idle to curse past, present, or to come, for in all
three a man but curses himself. But I am far
removed from that faith, and that belief is become a
strange and hostile one to me. I am no Papist.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The bully struck the table with his fist. “As my
name’s Anthony Mull, that’s not enough!”</p>

<p>And the justice echoed him with an owl-like look:
“That’s not enough!”</p>

<p>A colour came into Aderhold’s cheek. “There is,
my masters, no faith that has not in some manner
served the world and given voice to what we were
and are, good and bad. No faith without lives of
beauty and grace. No faith without its garland. But
since I am to clear myself of belonging to the old
religion—then I will say that I abhor—as in a
portion of myself, diseased, which I would have as
far otherwise as I might—that I abhor in that faith
all its cruelties past and present, its Inquisition, its
torturers and savage hate, its wars and blood-letting
and insensate strife, its falseness and cupidity and
great and unreasonable pride, its King Know-No-More
and its Queen Enquire-No-Further! I abhor
its leasing bulls, its anathemas and excommunications,
its iron portcullis dropped across the outward
and onward road, its hand upon the throat of knowledge
and its searing irons against the eyes of vision!
I say that it has made a dogma of the childhood of
the mind and that, or soon or late, there will stand
within its portals intellectual death—”</p>

<p>The table blinked. “At least,” said the justice
sagely, “you are no Papist!”</p>

<p>But the red and blue man would not be balked
of his prey. “That’s round enough, but little
enough as a true Churchman talks! You appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
me not one whit less one of us than you did before!
Master Pierce, Master Pierce! if he be not a masked
Jesuit, then is he a Marprelate man, a Banbury
man, a snuffling, Puritan, holy brother! Examine
him, Master Pierce! My name is not Mull, if he be
not somehow pillory fruit—”</p>

<p>It seemed that they all hated a Puritan as much
as a Papist. “Declare! Declare! Are you a Banbury
Saint and a Brother? Are you Reformed, a
Precisian, and a Presbyter? Are you John Calvin
and John Knox?”</p>

<p>But Aderhold kept a quiet forehead. “A brother
to any in the sense you mean—no. A saint—not
I! A Calvinist?—No, I am no Calvinist.”</p>

<p>“Not enough! Not enough!”</p>

<p>Aderhold looked at them, bright-eyed. “Then I
will say that Calvin burned Servetus. I will say that
where they have had power to persecute they have
persecuted! I will say that—”</p>

<p>Outside the Cap and Bells arose a great uproar.
Whether it were apprentices fighting, or an issue of
gentry and sword-play with—in either case—the
watch arriving, or whether it were a fire, or news,
perhaps, of the old Queen’s death—whatever it
was it behooved the Cap and Bells to know the
worst! All the revellers and disputers rose, made for
the door, became dispersed. Aderhold snatched up
his cloak and hat, laid a coin beside the empty
malmsey cup, sent one regretful glance in the direction
of the volume lying beside the great bowl, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
quitted the Cap and Bells. In the street was a glare
of light and the noise of running feet. The crowd
appeared to be rushing toward Thames bank, some
tall building upon it being afire. He let them go, and
drawing his cloak about him, turned in the direction
of his lodging.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he felt himself touched
on the shoulder. “Not so fast! A word with you,
friend!—You’ve put me out of breath—”</p>

<p>It proved to be the lawyer who had befriended
him. They were standing before some church.
Wall and porch, it rose above them, dark and vacant.
The lawyer looked about him, glanced along
the steps and into the hollow of the porch. “Bare
as is this land of grace!—Look you, friend, we
know that it is allowable at times to do that in danger
which we disavow in safety. Especially if we
have great things in trust.—I marked you quickly
enough for a man with a secret—and a secret more
of the soul and mind than of worldly goods. Hark
you! I’m as little as you one of the mass-denying
crew we’ve left. What! a man may go in troublous
times with the current and keep a still tongue—nay,
protest with his tongue that he loves the current—else
he’ll have a still tongue, indeed, and
neither lands nor business, nor perhaps bare life!
But when we recognize a friend—” He spoke
rapidly, in a voice hardly above a whisper, a sentence
or two further.</p>

<p>“You take me,” said Aderhold, “to be Catholic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
You mistake; I am not. I spoke without mask.”
Then, as the other drew back with an angry breath.
“You were quick and kindly and saved me from that
which it would have been disagreeable to experience.
Will you let me say but another word?”</p>

<p>“Say on,” said the other thickly, “but had I
known—”</p>

<p>The light from Thames bank reddening the street
even here, they drew a little farther into the shadow
of the porch. “I have travelled much,” said Aderhold,
“and seen many men and beliefs, and most
often the beliefs were strange to me, and I saw not
how any could hold them. Yet were the people
much what they were themselves, some kindly, some
unkindly, some hateful, some filled with all helpfulness.
I have seen men of rare qualities, tender and
honourable women and young children, believe what
to me were monstrous things. Everywhere I have
seen that men and women may be better than the
dogma that is taught them, seeing that what they
think they believe is wrapped in all the rest of their
being which believes no such thing. Both in the old
religion and in the Reformed have I known many a
heroic and love-worthy soul. Think as well as you
may of me, brother, and I will think well of thee—and
thank thee, besides,—”</p>

<p>“Cease your heretic talk!” said the lawyer. “I
held you to be of holy Mother Church—” With
suddenness, in the darkness, he put forth his foot
and swung his arm, at once tripping and striking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
physician with such violence that he came to the
ground with his forehead against the stone step of
the church. When he staggered to his feet the lawyer
was gone. Around him howled the March wind
and far above the church vane creaked. He stood for
a moment until the giddiness passed, then gathered
his cloak about him and, hurrying on through the
nipping air, reached his lodging without further
adventure.</p>

<p>That night he slept well. The next morning, as he
was eating his breakfast, that was spare enough, he
heard a loud and formal crying in the street below.
He went to the window. A crier was approaching, at
his heels a mob of boys and of the idle generally.
“<i>The Queen is Dead!—The Queen is Dead!—The
Queen is Dead!—Long Live King James!</i>”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TWO PHYSICIANS</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">He</span> went that morning to visit the alderman, inopportune
as he knew the visit would be esteemed.
But many things were inopportune—hunger, for
instance. The alderman found the visit offensively,
unpatriotically inopportune. “What! The King’s
Majesty’s ascension day—!” But one thing saved
Aderhold, and that was the presence in the alderman’s
parlour of some seven or eight cronies, men
and women. It would not do—it would not do for
the alderman to seem haggling and unwilling.
Aderhold quitted the house the richer by twelve
shillings.</p>

<p>The narrow streets were crowded; everybody was
out, excited and important as though he or she had
died or been crowned. The physician strolled with
the others. The morning was fine, he felt wealthy
and happy. The sunshine that stroked the projecting,
timbered fronts of houses was the sunshine of
home, the soft and moist light of England. He
loved England. He wandered for an hour or two
here and there in the London of less than two hundred
thousand souls. He went down to the riverside,
and sat upon a stone step, and gazed into the purple,
brooding distance.... At last he turned back, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
after a time found himself in the street of his lodging,
and before the house.</p>

<p>It was a narrow, poor, and gloomy place, owned
by people whom he guessed to have fallen on evil
days. The plainly dressed elderly woman from
whom he had hired his room had told him, indeed,
as much. “Aye?” said Aderhold. “Then, mother,
I’ll feel the more at home.” He had lodged here now
ten days and he had seen only the elderly woman
and her son, a boy far gone in consumption who
coughed and coughed. The woman was a silent,
rigid person, withered but erect, wearing a cap and
over her gown of dark stuff a coarse white kerchief
and apron. This morning, when she brought him his
half loaf and tankard of ale, he had spoken with
casualness of the Cap and Bells. She looked at him
strangely. “The Cap and Bells!... Doubtless you
heard good talk there.” Then had come the crying
about the Queen’s death. When he turned from the
window the woman was gone.</p>

<p>Now he entered the house. As he laid his hand
upon the stair-rail the woman stood framed in a
doorway. “Tarry a little,” she said. “I wish to tell
you that this house will lodge you no longer.”</p>

<p>Aderhold stood still, then turned. “And why,
good mother? I like my room and the house. I have
striven to be in no way troublesome.” He put his
hand in his purse and drew it forth with the alderman’s
shillings upon the palm. “You see I have
money. You’ll not lose by me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>A voice came from the room behind the woman.
“Let him enter, mother. We would see this fellow
who will make no trouble for us.”</p>

<p>Aderhold noted a pale triumph in the woman’s
strong, lined face and in her tense, updrawn figure.
“Aye, it happened to give thanks for!” she told him.
“Two things happened this morning. A King came
to the throne who, for all his mother’s scarlet and
raging sins, has himself been bred by godly men to
godly ways! And my two sons came home from
overseas!”</p>

<p>She turned and passed through the doorway into
the room from which she had come. Aderhold, after
a moment of hesitation, followed. It was a large,
dark place, very cold and bare. Here, too, was a
table, drawn toward the middle of the room, with a
cloth upon it and bread and a piece of meat. Beside
it, chair and stool pushed back, stood two men—the
returned sons Aderhold was at once aware. He
had seen before men like these men—English sectaries
abroad, men who stood with the Huguenots in
France, and in the Low Countries fought Spain and
the Devil with the soldiers of Orange. Estranged or
banished from home, lonely and insular, fighting
upon what they esteemed the Lord’s side, in the
place where they esteemed the fight to be hottest,
they exhibited small, small love and comradeship for
those in whose cause they fought. Only, truly, in
conventicles, could they seem to warm to people of
another tongue and history. Ultra-zealous, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Calvin than Calvin, trained to harshness in a frightful
war, iron, fanatic, back now they came to England,
the most admirable soldiers and the most
uncharitable men!</p>

<p>The two stood in their plain doublets, their great
boots, their small falling collars. They were tall and
hard of aspect, the one bearded, the other with a
pale, clean-shaven, narrow, enthusiast’s face. The
home-keeping son also had risen from table. He
stood beside his mother, coughing and pressing a
cloth to his lips.</p>

<p>The bearded man spoke. “Good-morrow, friend!”</p>

<p>“Good-morrow, friend,” answered Aderhold.</p>

<p>“You spoke that,” said the bearded man, “as
though you were indeed a friend, whereas we know
you to be but a Cap and Bells friend.”</p>

<p>“I do not take your meaning,” said Aderhold. “I
would be friends—no man knows how I would be
friends with men.”</p>

<p>The shaven man spoke. “Thou hypocritical prelate’s
man! Why did you let slip to my mother that
the Cap and Bells was your place of revelling and
roistering and blackening God to his face? As if,
before we went to the wars, the Cap and Bells was
not known for what it was—yea, and is! for my
mother saith the leopard hath not changed his spots
nor the Ethiop his skin—a bishop-loving, stained-glass
praising, Prayer-Book upholding, sacrament
kneeling, bowing, chanting, genuflecting, very pillar
and nest of prelacy! drinking-place of all they who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
if they had their wicked will, would give into the
hand of ruin—yea, would pillory and stock, yea,
would put to the rack if they might, yea, would give
to the flame if they were strong enough!—the Lord’s
chosen people, sole fence between this land and the
fate of the cities of the plain!”</p>

<p>“There have been before now,” said the bearded
man, “spies sent among the Lord’s people, and
always such have been received and comforted in
that same house—to wit, the Cap and Bells!”</p>

<p>The consumptive took the red cloth from his lips.
“Mother, mother, did I not say, when the man
came, that he had a strange look?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Andrew,” said the mother, “he went like a
man with a guilty load and watched his shadow.—But
I had you to think on, and the need for bread,
and he paid me, which, God knoweth! they do not
always do. And it came not into my head, until,
before he thought, he had said the ‘Cap and Bells,’
that he might be here to spy and wring news of us—cozening
us to tell reportable tales of the Lord’s
Saints!” She stopped, then spoke on with a high,
restrained passion and triumph. “But now—but
now I think that that is what he is! But now I am
not afraid—and now he may get his deserts—seeing
that the new King is surely for us, and that my
sons have come home!”</p>

<p>“The new King!” exclaimed the shaven man.
“The new King is an old Stuart! Lean upon that
reed and it will pierce your hand! I tell that to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
brother and to you, mother, and you will not believe—”</p>

<p>“Time will show,” said the bearded man impatiently.
“Time will show which of us is right. But
to-day my mother can turn out this bishop’s man,
neck and crop! Yea, and if he murmurs—”</p>

<p>He made a step forward, a big-boned, powerful
man, grim of countenance. His hand shot out
toward the physician.</p>

<p>Aderhold gave back a step, then recovered himself.
“You are mistaken,” he said. “I am no spy
and I am no bishop’s man. Like you, I have been
from England. I return poor and seeking physician’s
work. Desiring lodging, I asked at this house as I
had asked at others, and as honestly as a man may.
For the Cap and Bells, I knew naught of it nor of its
frequenters. I crossed its threshold but once, and so
ill did the place suit me that I am not like to go
again. I tell you the plain truth.”</p>

<p>The woman and her sons regarded him fixedly.
“What think you,” asked the shaven man at last,
abruptly and sternly, “of the law that maketh it an
offense for a man to worship his Creator after the
dictates of his own heart—yea, that would compel
him to conform to practices which his soul abhorreth?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Aderhold, “that it is an evil
law.”</p>

<p>“You say truth,” answered the shaven man.
“Now tell me plainly. Believe you in copes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
stoles and altars and credence tables, in kneeling at
communion, in Prayer-Book and surplice and bowing
when the name is mentioned, in bishops and
archbishops and pride of place before God?”</p>

<p>Aderhold looked at him dreamily. The fear of
physical injury, which was the weakness that most
beset him, was gone by. He had at times a strange
sense of expansion, accompanied by a differentiation
and deepening of light. The experience—he knew
it to be inward, and never steadfast, very fleeting—returned
to him now. The room looked world-wide,
the four interlocutors tribes and peoples. “My
mind does not dwell overmuch,” he said, “upon
matters such as these. They are little matters. The
wrong is that a man should be made to say they are
necessary and great matters, and, to avoid falseness,
be made to fight dwarfs as though they were giants.—I
need no priest in cope or surplice or especial
dress when all that I am lifts in contemplation and
resolve. I need not kneel when All communes with
All. No slave is my soul. Would I pray, I can pray
without book, and would I not, no book held before
my face hath power to pray for me. If I bowed my
head at each thought of the mystery that surrounds
us, I would not with overmuch frequency walk erect,
for I think much and constantly of that mystery. If
I bow my head without thought—an idiot may do
the same. As for prelates and they who are called
‘spiritual princes’—I have seen not one who is not
a man-chosen master of a man-built house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman spoke uncertainly. “If we have been
mistaken in you, sir,—”</p>

<p>“What you say has truth,” said the bearded man.
“But it also has a strangeness and rings not like our
truth.... If you are a Brownist, this house will
have naught to do with you!”</p>

<p>“I am not a Brownist,” said Aderhold wearily.
The sense of space widening off and intenser light
was gone. Never yet had it stayed but the fewest of
moments, and, going, it threw life back upon
itself....</p>

<p>But the second son, who had been standing with
an abstracted and distant look, started and spoke.
“Let him alone, mother and my brother! Whatever
he be, he hath no ill-will nor guile—” He turned to
the table. “Are you hungry?” he asked. “Sit down
and eat with us.”</p>

<p>Aderhold dwelt in this house some days longer.
He did not again see the two sons; they had taken
horse and ridden to visit some returned comrade
or officer in the country. The woman he saw, and
sometimes talked with, but she had ceased to be
curious about him, and they chiefly spoke of the
consumptive boy. He was near death. The physician
could only give something that should make
the nights pass more swiftly, less painfully.</p>

<p>He himself wished to see a physician, the physician
to whom, as to Cecil, he had been recommended
by a great noble of France, but whom he had not seen
since that day in Richmond, after that hour in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Queen’s chamber. He had gone to his house to enquire—he
was yet out of London, he would be
home on such a day. Aderhold went then, but could
not see him; waited two days, and was again denied;
went in another three, and was admitted. The physician
was alone, in a small room, and his manner
dry and cold.</p>

<p>If Aderhold still nursed a hope it was a faint and
failing one. Before that day in Richmond the hope
had been strong. This physician was a skilled man
and knew skill when he saw it—the great Frenchman
had written with a guarded enthusiasm, but yet
with enthusiasm of what Gilbert Aderhold might do—the
London physician had let drop a hint that
he himself had thought at times of an assistant—if
not that, he could certainly speak a word in season
in another quarter. Aderhold had hoped—after
Richmond he had hoped less strongly. Now he
found that hope was failing. What had happened?
What always happened?</p>

<p>The physician continued standing. The room
opened upon a garden, and outside the lattice window
there showed a tender mist of budding tree and
shrub. “You were so good,” said Aderhold, “as to
bid me come to you upon your return.”</p>

<p>“I wished,” said the physician, “to give all
weight and recognition to the commendation of the
Duke of ——.” A grey cat came and rubbed against
his ankle. He stooped and lifting the creature to the
table beside him stood stroking it. “The commendation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of great noblemen is at times like their largesse.
It often falls—through, of course, no fault of
theirs—before the stranger and the unworthy.”</p>

<p>“If I be unworthy,” said Aderhold, “yet I am not
strange to that nobleman, nor, I think, unloved by
him. He has been my good patron, almost, I might
dare to say, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Aye?” said the physician. “It has come to
Court ears, with other French news, that the Duke
is out of favour.... Moreover, a friend of my own
has lately returned from Paris where he had long
resided. He is a man of the world, with a great
interest in life and a knowledge of what is talked
about, small things as well as great. He told me”—the
physician paused—“of <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Aderhold said dully; “of me?”</p>

<p>“He brought you in as a slight case, but typical, of
what grows up in the narrow strip between religious
wars and factions, between Leaguer and Huguenot—to
wit, something that is neither Catholic nor
Protestant, which the Leaguer would burn and the
Huguenot would flay! He told me of your case and
your trial and imprisonment, and how none would
help you, neither Papist nor Reformed, but only this
one nobleman whose child, it seems, you had healed,
and even he could only help by helping you forth
from France.” The physician continued to draw his
hand over the grey fur. “I quarrel with that nobleman
for considering that an atheist might prosper
here in England, and for deceivingly writing to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
only of his skill in all that pertained to his art! I
might,” said the physician, “have become involved
in what discovery and disfavour you may bring upon
yourself in this realm!”</p>

<p>“I am not,” said Aderhold, “an atheist. Sanction
and authority and restraint are within.”</p>

<p>The other shrugged. “Oh, your fine distinctions!”
He went to the window and set it wider so that the
whole green garden and white and rosy branches of
bloom seemed to come into the room. “I am not,”
he said, with his back to the lattice, “myself a
theologian. By nature I am a ‘live and let live’ man.
Peter, Luther, Calvin, Mohammed, and Abraham
each may have had his own knowledge of heaven and
hell! I will not quarrel with knowledge for being
various. I am tolerant—I am tolerant, Master
Aderhold! But I hold with emphasis that you must
not inculpate others—no, you must not let the edge
of your mantle of heresy touch another! It were base
ingratitude, for instance, were you—”</p>

<p>“I have been careful,” said Aderhold, “to mention
your name to no one. I have led since seeing
you a retired and soundless life. I am a stranger in
this city and none knows my life, nor feels an interest
in it.”</p>

<p>The physician’s countenance showed relief. “I
did not know of what folly you might not have been
capable!” He stroked the cat, moved a few paces
about the room and returned. “I regret that I can
give you no aid. Indeed, I must tell you plainly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
I owe it to my family and my patients and my place—which
is no slight one—in the esteem of this
city, to refuse all association with a man who at any
hour may fall under suspicion and prosecution.”
He paused. “I may say to you once, and this once
only, that I find your case a hard one. I certainly
advise you not to be stiff-necked, but living in the
world to conform to the world. Philosophize, if you
choose, but inwardly, inwardly, man!”</p>

<p>He spoke quite amiably, even genially. It was
apparent that Aderhold had taken his dismissal,
that he was not going to beg or be distressful. He
considered through the open casement the height of
the sun. He could give the unfortunate man a
minute or two longer. “Let us speak a moment,” he
said, “of our art. London is thronged with doctors.
I tell you truly that there is scant room for another,
even were the circumstances not as they are, and
you were as like others as you are unlike. However
still a tongue you may keep,—and I think you may
betray yourself oftener than you think,—you will
eventually be found out.” He lifted his finger impressively.
“Now the temper of the time is religious
and growing ever more so. The Italian and antique
spirit that I remember is going—is almost gone.
We are all theologians and damn the whole world
outside of our particular ark. People of the old
faith, people of the established faith, people of the
Presbytery—each of the three detests and will
persecute the remaining two. Right and left suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
from the middle, which is in power, as the middle—and
the remaining other—would suffer were the
right or left in power. War, secret or open, war, war!
and they only unite to plague a witch or to run to
earth and burn for heresy one like you who belongs
not to right nor left nor middle. The tolerant,
humane, philosophic heart dissents—but few, my
friend, are tolerant and humane, too few, too few!
All this being so, I do not advise you to remain in
London—no, I should not, were you Galen
himself!”</p>

<p>Aderhold stood gazing at the garden without.
There were thorn hedges everywhere—across all
paths. “I do not know,” he said, “where I should
go—”</p>

<p>“My advice,” said his fellow physician, “would
be to travel to some smaller town that hath never
received a whisper from France. And now”—he
rose—“and now I must bid you good-bye, for an
important personage expects me at this hour.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ROSE TAVERN</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Three</span> days after this conversation Gilbert Aderhold
said good-bye to the Puritan woman and her
son, shouldered a stick with a bundle at the end, and
set his face toward the periphery of London and the
green country beyond. He had no money. The idea
of asking his fellow physician for a loan haunted him
through one night, but when morning came the
ghost was laid. He strongly doubted if the other
would make the loan and he did not wish to ask it
anyhow. Since he had been in London he had given
a cast of his art more than once or twice in this
neighbourhood. But it was a poor neighbourhood,
and those whom he had served had been piteous
folk, and he did not think that they could pay. He
had not asked them to pay. He had no connections
in London, no friends. His knowledge of men told
him that, for all his tolerance and humanity, the
fellow physician might be expected to drop a word
of warning, here and there, among the brotherhood.
His hope had been that his case was so obscure that
no talk would come from Paris.... It was not only
that the arm of religion had been raised; he had
invoked in medicine, too, strange gods of observation
and experience; he had been hounded forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
with a double cry. To linger in London, to try to
work and earn here—with a shudder he tasted
beforehand the rebuff that might come. He would
leave London.</p>

<p>He was without near kindred. His parents were
dead, a sister also. There was an elder brother, a
sea-captain. Aderhold had not seen him for years,
and fancied him now somewhere upon the ocean or
adventuring in the New World. He remembered
his mother telling him that there were or had
been cousins to the north. She had spoken of an
elderly man, living somewhere in a Grange. The
name was Hardwick, not Aderhold.... He had no
defined idea or intention of seeking kinsmen, but
eventually he turned his face toward the north.</p>

<p>It was six in the morning when he stepped forth.
Slung beside his bundle of clothing and a book or
two, wrapped in a clean cloth, was a great loaf of
bread which the Puritan woman had given him.
There was a divine, bright sweetness and freshness
in the air and the pale-blue heaven over all. He
turned into Fleet Street and walked westward.
The apprentices were opening the shops, country
wares were coming into town, the city was beginning
to bustle. Aderhold walked, looking to right and
left, interested in all. He was not a very young
man, but he was young. Health and strength had
been rudely shaken by anxiety, fear, and misery.
Anxiety still hovered, and now and then a swift, upstarting
fear cut him like a whip and left him quivering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
But fear and anxiety were going further,
weakening, toning down. Calm was returning, calm
and rainbow lights.</p>

<p>Hereabouts in the street were all manner of small
shops, places of entertainment, devices by which to
catch money. The apprentices were beginning their
monotonous crying, “What d’ye lack? What d’ye
lack?”</p>

<p>He came to a booth where there was a raree show.
A shock-headed, ragged youth was taking down
the boards, which were painted with figures of Indians,
copper-hued and feathered. Half a dozen
children stood watching.</p>

<p>Aderhold stopped and watched also. “Have you
an Indian here,” he asked the boy. “I have never
seen one.”</p>

<p>The youth nodded. “He sleeps in the corner back
of the curtain. You pay twopence to see him—”
He grinned, and looked at the children. “But it’s
before hours, and if so be you won’t tell master on
me—”</p>

<p>“We won’t, master, we won’t!” chorused the
children.</p>

<p>The boy took down the last board, showing a
concave much like a den with a black curtain at the
back. He whistled and the curtain stirred. “We
got him,” said the boy, “from two Spaniards who
got him from a ship from Florida. They trained him.
They had a bear, too, that we bought, but the bear
died.” He whistled again. The curtain parted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the Indian came forth and sat upon a stool planted
in the middle of the den.</p>

<p>It was evident that he had been “trained.”
Almost naked, gaunt, dull and hopeless, he sat with
a lack-lustre eye. The boy whistled again and he
spoke, a guttural and lifeless string of words. The
children gathered close, flushed and excited. But
Aderhold’s brows drew upward and together and
he turned a little sick. He was a physician; he was
used to seeing wretchedness, but it had not deadened
him. Every now and then the wave of human
misery came and went over him, high as space, ineffably
dreary, unutterably hopeless.... He stood
and looked at the Indian for a few moments, then,
facing from the booth, walked away with a rapid
and disturbed step which gradually became slower
and halted. He turned and went back. “Has he eaten
this morning? You don’t give him much to eat?”</p>

<p>“Times are hard,” said the boy.</p>

<p>Aderhold took the smaller bundle from his stick,
unwrapped it and with his knife cut from the loaf a
third of its mass. “May I give him this?”</p>

<p>The boy stared. “If you choose, master.”</p>

<p>The physician entered the booth, went up to the
Indian and placed the bread upon his knee. “Woe
are we,” he said, “that can give no efficient help!”</p>

<p>The savage and the European looked each other
in the eyes. For a moment something hawk-like,
eagle-like, came back and glanced through the pupils
of the red man, then it sank and fled. His eyes grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
dull again, though he made a guttural sound and his
hand closed upon the bread. The physician stood a
moment longer. He had strongly the sacred wonder
and curiosity, the mother of knowledge, and he had
truly been interested to behold an Indian. Now he
beheld one—but the iron showed more than the
soul. “I am sorry for thee, my brother,” Aderhold
said softly.</p>

<p>The boy spoke from without. “Hist, hist! Master’s
coming down the street.”</p>

<p>Aderhold left the booth, shouldered his stick and
bundle and went on his way.</p>

<p>He walked steadily, the sun at his back, lifting
through the mist and at last gilding the whole city.
He was now upon its northwestern fringe, in the
“suburbs.” They had an evil name, and he was
willing to pass through them hurriedly. They had a
sinister look,—net-work of foul lanes, low, wooden,
squinting houses, base taverns that leered.</p>

<p>A woman came and walked beside him, paint on
her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, my bonny man?” Then,
as he would have outstepped her, “What haste?
Lord! what haste?”</p>

<p>“I have a long way to go,” said Aderhold.</p>

<p>“As long and as short as I have to go,” said the
woman. “If you are willing we might go together.”</p>

<p>Aderhold walked on, “I am not for that gear,
mistress.”</p>

<p>“No?” said the woman. “Then for what gear are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
you?... Perhaps I am not for it, either, but—Lord
God! one must eat!” She began to sing in a
cracked voice but vaguely sweet.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“A lass there dwelled in London town—</p>
<p class="pp7">‘Alas!’ she said, ‘Alas!’ she said,</p>
<p class="pp8s">‘Of gold and land</p>
<p class="pp8">I’ve none in hand—’”</p>

<p class="p1">They were coming flush with the opening of a
small, dim courtyard. She broke off her song.
“Bring your stick and bundle in front of you! This
is a marked place for snatchers.”</p>

<p>Her warning was not idle. As he shifted the stick
a shaggy, bull-headed man made a move from
shadow to sunlight, lurched against him and grasped
at the bundle. Aderhold slipping aside, the fellow
lost his balance and came almost to the ground. The
woman laughed. Enraged, the bull-headed man
drew a knife and made at the physician, but the
woman, coming swiftly under his raised arm, turned,
and grasping wrist and hand, gave so sudden a
wrench that the knife clanked down upon the
stones. She kicked it aside into the gutter, her
face turned to Aderhold. “Be off, my bonny man!”
she advised. “No, he’ll not hurt me! We’re old
friends.”</p>

<p>Aderhold left the suburbs behind, left London
behind. He was on an old road, leading north. For
the most part, during the next few days, he kept to
this road, though sometimes he took roughly paralleling,
less-frequented ways, and sometimes footpaths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
through fields and woods. Now he walked briskly,
enjoying the air, hopeful with the hopeful day.
Sometime in the morning an empty cart overtook
him, the carter walking by his horse. They walked
together up a hill and talked of the earth and the
planting and the carting of stuffs and the rates paid
and the ways of horses. Level ground reached, the
carter offered a lift, and the two travelled some miles
together, chiefly in a friendly silence. At midday
Aderhold unwrapped his loaf of bread, and the carter
produced bread, too, and a bit of cheese and a
jug containing ale. They ate and drank, jogging
along by April hedges and budding trees. A little
later the carter must turn aside to some farm, and,
wishing each other well, they parted.</p>

<p>This day and the next Aderhold walked, by green
country and Tudor village and town, by smithy and
mill, by country houses set deep in giant trees, by
hamlet and tavern, along stretches of lonely road
and through whispering, yet unvanished forests.
The sun shone, the birds sang, the air was a ripple of
zephyrs. The road had its traffic, ran an unwinding
ribbon of spectacle. There were the walls of country
and the roof of sky and a staccato presence of brute
and human life. Now horsemen went by—knightly
travel or merchant travel, or a judge or lawyer, or
a high ecclesiastic. Serving-men walked or rode,
farming folk, a nondescript of trade or leisure.
Drovers came by with cattle, country wains, dogs.
A pedlar with his pack kept him company for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
while. Country women passed, carrying butter and
eggs to market, children coming from school, three
young girls, lithe, with linked arms, a parson and his
clerk, an old seaman, a beggar, a charcoal-burner, a
curious small troupe of mummers and mountebanks,
and for contrast three or four mounted men somewhat
of the stripe of the widow’s sons. One looked
a country gentleman and another a minister of the
stricter sort. They gazed austerely at the mummers
as they passed. Now life flowed in quantity upon the
road, now the stream dwindled, now for long distances
there was but the life of the dust, tree and
plant, and the air.</p>

<p>When the second sunset came he was between
hedged fields in a quiet, solitary country of tall trees,
with swallows circling overhead in a sky all golden
like the halos around saints’ heads in pictures that
he remembered in Italy. No house was visible, nor,
had one been so, had he made up his mind to ask the
night’s lodging. The day had been warm, even the
light airs had sunk away, the twilight was balm and
stillness. He possessed a good cloak, wide and warm.
With the fading of the gold from the sky he turned
aside from the road upon which, up and down as far
as he could see, nothing now moved, broke through
the hedge, found an angle and spread his cloak
within its two walls of shelter. The cloak was wide
enough to lie upon and cover with, his bundle made
a pillow. The stars came out; in some neighbouring,
marshy place the frogs began their choiring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Although he was tired enough, he could not sleep
at once, nor even after a moderate time of lying
there, in his ears the monotonous, not unmusical
sound. He thought of what he should do to-morrow,
and he could not tell. Walk on? Yes. How far, and
where should he stop? So far he had not begged, but
that could not last. The colour came into his cheek.
He did not wish to beg. And were there no pride in
the matter, there was the law of the land. Beggars
and vagabonds and masterless men, how hardly
were they dealt with! They were dealt with savagely,
and few asked what was the reason or where
was the fault. <i>Work.</i> Yes, he would work, but how
and where? Dimly he had thought all along of stopping
at last in some town or village, of some merciful
opportunity floating to him, of tarrying, staying
there—finding room somewhere—his skill shown—some
accident, perhaps, some case like the alderman’s
wife ... a foothold, a place to grip with the
hand, then little by little to build up. Quiet work,
good work, people to trust him, assurance, a cranny
of peace at last ... and all the time the light growing.
But where was the cranny, and how would he
find the way to it?</p>

<p>Over him shone the Sickle. He lay and wondered,
and at last he slept, with the Serpent rising in the east.</p>

<p>Late in the night, waking for a moment, he saw
that the sky was overcast. The air, too, was colder.
He wrapped the cloak more closely about him and
slept again. When he woke the day was here, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
not such a day as yesterday. The clouds hung grey
and threatening, the wind blew chill. There set in a
day of weariness and crosses. It passed somehow.
Footsore, at dusk, he knocked at a cotter’s door,
closed fast against the wind which was high. When
the family questioned him, he told them that he was
a poor physician, come from overseas, going toward
kinspeople. There chanced to be a sick child in the
cottage; they let him stay for reading her fever and
telling them what to do.</p>

<p>The next day and the next and the next the sky
was greyer yet, and the wind still blew. It carried
with it flakes of snow. The road stretched bare,
none fared abroad who could stay indoors. Aderhold
now stumbled as he walked. There was a humming
in his ears. In the early afternoon of his sixth day
from London he came to as lonely a strip of country
as he had seen, lonely and grey and furrowed and
planted with a gnarled wood. The flakes were coming
down thickly.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, beyond a turn of the road, he
saw a small inn, set in a courtyard among trees. As
he came nearer he could tell the sign—a red rose on
a black ground. It was a low-built house with a
thatched roof, and firelight glowed through the
window. The physician had a bleeding foot; he
was cold, cold, and dizzy with fatigue. He had no
money, and the inn did not look charitable. In the
last town he had passed through he had bought food
and the night’s lodging with a portion of the contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of his bundle. Now he sat down upon the root
of a tree overhanging the road, opened his shrunken
store, and considered that with most of what was
left he might perhaps purchase lodging and fare
until the sky cleared and his strength came back. A
while before he had passed one on the road who told
him that some miles ahead was a fairly large town.
He might press on to that ... but he was tired, horribly
tired, and shivering with the cold. In the end,
keeping the bundle in his hand, he went and knocked
at the door of the Rose Tavern.</p>

<p>The blowsed servant wench who answered finally
brought her master the host, a smooth, glib man
with a watery eye. He looked at the stuff Aderhold
offered in payment and looked at the balance of the
bundle. In the end, he gestured Aderhold into the
house. It was warm within and fairly clean with a
brightness of scrubbed pannikins, and in the kitchen,
opening from the chief room, a vision of flitches of
bacon and strings of onions hanging from the rafters.
Besides the serving-maid and a serving-man there
was the hostess, a giant of a woman with a red kerchief
about her head. She gave Aderhold food.
When it was eaten he stretched himself upon the
settle by the kitchen hearth, arms beneath his head.
The firelight danced on the walls, there was warmth
and rest....</p>

<p>Aderhold lay and slept. Hours passed. Then, as
the day drew toward evening, he half roused, but lay
still upon the settle, in the brown warmth. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
was a feeling about him of peace and deep forests,
of lapping waves, of stars that rose and travelled to
their meridians and sank, of long, slow movements
of the mind. The minutes passed. He started full
awake with the hearing of horses trampling into the
courtyard and a babel of voices. He sat up, and the
serving-wench coming at the moment into the kitchen
he asked her a question. She proved a garrulous
soul who told all she knew. The Rose Tavern stood
some miles from a good-sized town. Those in the yard
and entering the house were several well-to-do merchants
and others with their serving-men. They had
been to London, travelling together for company, and
were now returning to this town. There was with
them Master—she couldn’t think of his name—of
Sack Hall in the next county. And coming in at the
same time, and from London, too, there was old
Master Hardwick who lived the other side of Hawthorn
village, in a ruined old house, and was a miser.
If <i>he</i> had been to London it would be sure to have been
about money. And finally there was Squire Carthew’s
brother, also from Hawthorn way. He was a fine
young man, but very strict and religious. The company
wasn’t going to stay—it wished food and hot
drink and to go on, wanting to reach the town before
night. And here the hostess descended upon the girl
and rated her fiercely for an idle, loose-tongue gabbling
wench—</p>

<p>Aderhold, rested, rose from the settle and went
into the greater room. Here were the seven or eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
principal travellers—the serving-men being without,
busy with the riding and sumpter horses. All in
the room were cold, demanding warmth and drink,—peremptory,
authoritative, well-to-do burghers
of a town too large for village manners and not large
enough for a wide urbanity. In a corner, on a bed
made of a bench and stool, with a furred mantle for
cover, lay a lean old man with a grey beard. He was
breathing thick and hard, and now and again he
gave a deep groan. A young serving-man stood
beside him, but with a dull and helpless aspect
toward sickness. Across the room, standing by a
window, appeared a man of a type unlike the others
in the room. Tall and well-made, he had a handsome
face, but with a strange expression as of warring
elements. There showed a suppressed passionateness,
and there showed a growing austerity. His
dress was good, but dark and plain. He was booted
and cloaked, and his hat which he kept upon his
head was plain and wide-brimmed. Aderhold,
glancing toward him, saw, he thought, one of the
lesser gentry, with strong Puritan leanings. This
would be “Squire Carthew’s brother.”</p>

<p>As he looked, the serving-man left the greybeard
stretched upon the bench, went across to the window,
and, cap in hand, spoke a few words. The man
addressed listened, then strode over to the chimney-corner
and stood towering above the sick man.
“Are you so ill, Master Hardwick? Bear up, until
you can reach the town and a leech!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Aderhold, who had not left the doorway, moved
farther into the room. Full in the middle of it, a man
who had had his back to him swung around. He
encountered one whom he had encountered before—to
wit, the red and blue bully of the Cap and Bells.
Master Anthony Mull did not at first recognize him.
He was blustering against the host of the Rose
because there was no pasty in the house. The physician
would fain have slipped past, but the other
suddenly gave a start and put out a pouncing hand.
“Ha, I know you! You’re the black sorcerer and
devil’s friend at the Cap and Bells who turned a
book into a bowl of sack!”</p>

<p>He had a great hectoring voice. The travellers in
the room, all except the group in the corner, turned
their heads and stared. Aderhold, attempting to
pass, made a gesture of denial and repulsion. “Ha!
Look at him!” cried Master Anthony Mull. “He
makes astrologer’s signs—warlock’s signs! Look if
he doesn’t bring a fiend’s own storm upon us ere we
get to town!”</p>

<p>Very quiet, kindly, not easily angered, Aderhold
could feel white wrath rise within him. He felt it
now—felt a hatred of the red and blue man. The
most of those in the room were listening. It came
to him with bitterness that this bully and liar with
his handful of idle words might be making it difficult
for him to tarry, to fall into place if any place invited,
in the town ahead. He had had some such idea.
They said it was a fair town, with some learning....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>He clenched his hands and pressed his lips together.
To answer in words was alike futile and
dangerous; instead, with a shake of the head, he
pushed by the red and blue man. The other might
have followed and continued the baiting, but some
further and unexpected dilatoriness exhibited by the
Rose Tavern fanned his temper into conflagration.
He joined the more peppery of the merchants in a
general denouncement and prophecy of midnight ere
they reached the town. Aderhold, as far from him
as he could get, put under the surge of anger and
alarm. He stood debating within himself the propriety
of leaving the inn at once, before Master Mull
could make further mischief. The cold twilight
and the empty road without were to be preferred to
accusations, in this age, of any difference in plane.</p>

<p>The sick man near him gave a deep groan, struggled
to a sitting posture, then fell to one side in a fit
or swoon, his head striking against the wall. The
young serving-man uttered an exclamation of distress
and helplessness. The man with the plain hat,
who had turned away, wheeled and came back with
knitted brows. There was some commotion in the
room among those who had noticed the matter, but
yet no great amount. The old man seemed unknown
to some and to others known unfavourably.</p>

<p>Aderhold crossed to the bench and bending over
the sufferer proceeded to loosen his ruff and shirt.
“Give him air,” he said, and then to the tall man,
“I am a physician.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>They laid Master Hardwick upon a bed in an
inner room, where, Aderhold doing for him what he
might, he presently revived. He stared about him.
“Where am I? Am I at the Oak Grange? I thought
I was on the road from London. Where is Will, my
man?”</p>

<p>“He is without,” said Aderhold. “Do you want
him? I am a physician.”</p>

<p>Master Hardwick lay and stared at him. “No,
no! You are a leech? Stay with me.... Am I going
to die?”</p>

<p>“No. But you do not well to travel too far abroad
nor to place yourself where you will meet great
fatigues.”</p>

<p>The other groaned. “It was this one only time. I
had monies at stake and none to straighten matters
out but myself.” He lay for a time with closed eyes,
then opened them again upon Aderhold. “I must
get on—I must get home—I must get at least as
far as the town to-night. Don’t you think that I
can travel?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you go carefully,” said Aderhold. “I will
tell your man what to do—”</p>

<p>The old man groaned. “He works well at what he
knows, but he knows so little.... I do not know if I
will get home alive.”</p>

<p>“How far beyond the town have you to go?”</p>

<p>“Eight miles and more.... Doctor, are you not
travelling, too? You’ve done me good—and if I
were taken again—” He groaned. “I’m a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
man,—they make a great mistake when they say
I’m rich,—but if you’ll ride with me I’ll pay
somehow—”</p>

<p>Aderhold sat in silence, revolving the matter in
his mind. “I have,” he said at last, “no horse.”</p>

<p>But Master Hardwick had with him a sumpter
horse. “Will can now ride that and now walk. You
may have Will’s horse.” He saw the long miles,
cold and dark, before him and grew eager. “I’m a
sick man and I must get home.” He raised himself
upon the bed. “You go with me—you’ve got a
kindly look—you do not seem strange to me.
What is your name?”</p>

<p>“My name is Gilbert Aderhold.”</p>

<p>“Aderhold!” said Master Hardwick. “My mother’s
mother was an Aderhold.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ROAD TO HAWTHORN</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was full dusk when the London travellers did at
last win away from the Rose Tavern. The evening
was cold, the snow yet falling in slow, infrequent
flakes. The merchants and their men, together with
Master Anthony Mull, first took the road. Then
followed Master Harry Carthew, straight and stern,
upon a great roan mare. In the rear came on slowly
old John Hardwick, his servant Will, and the physician
Gilbert Aderhold. These three soon lost sight
of the others, who, pushing on, came to the town,
rest, and bed, ere they had made half the distance.</p>

<p>At last, very late, the place loomed before them.
They passed through dark and winding streets, and
found an inn which Master Hardwick knew. Together
Will and Aderhold lifted the old man from his
horse and helped him into the house and into a great
bed, where he lay groaning through the night, the
physician beside him speaking now and again a
soothing and steadying word.</p>

<p>He could not travel the next day or the next.
Finally Aderhold and Will wrung permission to hire
a litter and two mules. On the third morning they
placed Master Hardwick in the litter and all took the
street leading to the road which should bring them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the afternoon to the Oak Grange. Going, they
passed a second inn, and here Master Harry Carthew
suddenly appeared beside them upon his great
roan. It seemed that affairs had kept him likewise
in this town, but that now he was bound in their
direction.</p>

<p>The snow had passed into rain. The weather had
moderated, the rain ceased, and this morning there
was pure blue sky and divine sunlight. The latter
bathed the unpaved streets, the timbered, projecting
fronts of houses, guildhall and shops and marketplace,
and the tower and body of a great and ancient
abbey church. Beyond the church the ground
sloped steeply to the river winding by beneath an
arched bridge of stone. Above the town, commanding
all, rose a castle, half-ruinous, half in repair. The
streets were filled with people, cheerful in the morning
air. Litter, mules, and horsemen moved slowly
along. Honest Will drew a long breath. “Fegs! Who
would live in the country that could live in a town?”</p>

<p>Aderhold was riding beside him, Carthew being
ahead on his great roan mare. “Tell me something,”
said the physician, “of the country to which we are
going.”</p>

<p>“The country’s a good country enough,” said
Will. “But the Oak Grange—Lord! the Grange is
doleful and lonely—”</p>

<p>“Doleful and lonely?”</p>

<p>“It’s all buried in black trees,” said Will, “and
nobody lives there but our old master.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where does Master Carthew live?”</p>

<p>“He lives in the squire’s house beyond the village.
He’s the squire’s brother.”</p>

<p>“You’re near a village?”</p>

<p>“Aye, the village of Hawthorn.”</p>

<p>They rode on, Will gazing busily about him. They
were still in the town, indeed in an important part
of it, for before them rose the prison. Without it
stood pillory and stocks, two men by the legs in the
latter, a dozen children deliberately pelting them
with rotten vegetables, shards, and mud. Aderhold
stared with a frown, the countryman with a curious
mixture of interest in the event and lumpish indifference
as to the nature of it. “Aye,” he repeated,
“the village of Hawthorn.”</p>

<p>“Is there,” asked Aderhold, “a physician in the
village?”</p>

<p>They had passed the prison, and were approaching
the sculptured portal of the great church. “A
physician?” said Will. “No. There was one, but he
died two years ago. Now they send here, or the
schoolmaster will bleed at a pinch or give a drench.
And sometimes they go—but the parson would
stop that—to old Mother Spuraway.”</p>

<p>They were now full before the great portal of the
church. Carthew, ahead, stopped his horse to speak
to some person who seemed an acquaintance. His
halting in the narrow way halted the mules with the
litter. Master Hardwick had fallen into a doze. The
physician and serving-man, standing their horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
together, looked up at the huge pile of the church,
towering like a cliff immediately above them. On
each side of the vast arched doorway had stood in
niches the figures of saints. These were broken and
gone—dragged down in the day when the neighbouring
abbey was closed. But around and about,
overhead and flanking the cavernous entrance,
had been left certain carvings—a train of them—imps
and devils and woe-begone folk possessed by
the foul fiend. The fiend grinned over the shoulder
of one like a monkey, he tugged like a wolf at the ear
of another, he crept like a mouse from a woman’s
mouth.... Aderhold’s gaze was upon the great
tower against the sky and the rose-window out
of which the stained glass was not yet broken. But
Will looked lower. Something presently causing the
physician to glance his way, he was startled at the
serving-man’s posture and expression. It was as
though he had never seen these stone figures before—and,
indeed, it proved that he had never been
so closely within the porch, and that, in short, they
had never so caught his attention. He was staring at
them now as though his eyeballs and all imagination
behind them were fastened by invisible wires to the
grotesque and horrible carvings. Into his countenance
came a creeping terror and a kind of fearful
exaltation. Aderhold knew the look—he had seen
it before, in France and elsewhere, upon peasant
faces and upon faces that were not those of peasants.
It was not an unusual look in his century. Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
for the millionth time, imagination had been seized
and concentrated upon the Satanic and was creating
a universe to command. Will shivered, then he put
his hand to his ear.</p>

<p>“There is nothing there,” said the physician,
“but your ear itself.”</p>

<p>“Mice never come out of men’s mouths,” said
Will. The physician knew the voice, too, the dry-throated,
rigid-tongued monotone. “The comfort
is that most of the wicked are women.”</p>

<p>“Then take comfort,” said Aderhold, “and come
away. Those figures are but the imagination of men
like yourself.”</p>

<p>But Will was not ready to budge. “Twelfth night,
I was going through the fields. They were white
with snow. Something black ran across and howled
and snapped at me.”</p>

<p>“A famished wolf,” said Aderhold.</p>

<p>“Aye, it looked like a wolf. But this is what
proved it wasn’t,” said Will. “That night in Hawthorn
Forest Jock the forester set a trap. In the
night-time he heard it click down on the wolf and the
wolf howl. He said, says he, ‘I’ve got you now, old
demon!’ and went back to sleep. But at dawn,
when he went to the trap, there was blood there and
a tuft of grizzled hair, but nothing else. And so he
and his son followed red spots on the snow—right
through the forest and across Town Road. And on
the other side of the road, where the hedge comes
down, they lost it clean—not a drop of blood nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the mark of a paw on the snow. But the dog they
had he ran about, and at last he lifted his head and
bayed, and then he started—And where, sir, do you
think he led them? He led them to the hut of old
Marget Primrose between Black Hill and Hawthorn
Brook. And Marget was lying huddled, crying with
a bloody cut across her ankle. And they matched
the hair from the trap with the hair under her cap.”</p>

<p>“They did not match with care,” said Aderhold.
“And there are many ways by which a foot may be
hurt.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the serving-man, “but when they
brought the trap and thrust her leg in it the marks
fitted.” He continued to stare at the stone wolf
tearing the ear. “That’s been four years, and never
since have I been able to abide the sight of a wolf!...
Witches and warlocks and wizards and what
they call incubi and succubi and all the demons and
fiends of hell, and Satan above saying, ‘Hist! this
one!’ and ‘Hist! that one!’ and your soul lost and
dragged to hell where you will burn in brimstone,
shrieking, and God and the angels mocking you and
crying, ‘Burn! Burn forever!’—Nay, an if they do
not get your soul, still they ravage and ruin what
you have on earth—blast the fields and dry the
streams, slay cow and sheep and horse, burn your
cot and wither your strength of a man.... Thicker
than May flies in the air—all the time close around
you, whether you see them or you don’t see them—monkeys
and wolves and bat wings flapping....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Once something came on my breast at night—Satan,
Satan avaunt!”</p>

<p>Aderhold leaned across, seized the bridle of the
other’s horse, and forcibly turned Will from further
contemplation of the sculptured portal. “Come
away, or you will fall down in a fit!”</p>

<p>Carthew ahead was in motion, the mules with the
litter following. Will rode for a few paces with a
dazed look which was gradually replaced by his
usual aspect. The red came back into his cheeks, the
spring into his figure. By the time they had reached
the bridge he was ready for something palely resembling
a disinterested discussion of the supernatural.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it true, sir, that witch or warlock, however
they’ve been roaming, must take their own
shape when they cross running water?”</p>

<p>“Whatever shape matter takes is its own shape,”
said the physician, “and would be though we saw it
in a thousand shapes, one after the other. I have
never seen, nor expect to see, a witch or warlock.”</p>

<p>“Why, where have you travelled, sir?” asked the
yeoman bluntly; then, without waiting for an answer,
“They’re hatching thick and thicker in England,
though not so thick as they are in Scotland.
In Scotland they’re very thick. Our new King,
they say, does most fearfully hate them! Parson
preached about them not long ago. He said that
we’d presently see a besom used in this kingdom
that would sweep such folk from every corner into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the fire! He read from the Bible and it said, ‘Thou
shalt not suffer a witch to live!’”</p>

<p>He spoke with considerable cheer, the apple-red
back in his cheeks. “It’s good to feel,” he said,
“that they are nearly all women.”</p>

<p>They were trampling across the bridge, on either
hand the sparkling water, above their heads the
vivid sky. “They are neither man nor woman,”
said Aderhold. “They are naught. There are no
witches.”</p>

<p>He had spoken abstractedly, and more unguardedly
than was his wont. The words were no sooner
from his tongue than he felt alarm. They were not
safe words to have spoken, even in such simple
company as this. He looked aside and found that
Will was staring, round-eyed. “No witches?” asked
Will slowly. “Parson saith that none but miscreants
and unbelievers—”</p>

<p>“Tell me about your church and parson,” said
Aderhold calmly, and, aided by a stumble of Will’s
horse and some question from the litter behind them,
avoided for that time the danger.</p>

<p>They crossed the bridge and left behind the winding
river and the town that climbed to the castle,
clear-cut and dark against the brilliant sky. Before
them, lapped in the golden sunshine, spread a rich
landscape. Field and meadow, hill and dale, crystal
stream and tall, hanging woods, it flickered and
waved in the gilt light and the warm, blowing wind.
There were many trees by the wayside, and in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
branches a singing and fluttering of birds. The distance
shimmered; here was light and here were violet
shadows and everywhere hung the breath of spring.
From a hilltop they saw, some miles away, roofs and
a church tower. “Hawthorn Village,” said Will.
“The Oak Grange is two miles the other side.”</p>

<p>Master Hardwick parted the curtains of the litter
and called to the physician. His heart, he said, was
beating too slowly; it frightened him, he thought it
might be going to stop. Aderhold reassured him.
He had a friendly, humorous, strengthening way with
his patients; they brightened beneath his touch, and
this old man was no exception. Master Hardwick
was comforted and said that he thought he could
sleep a little more. His lean hand clutched the
other’s wrist as he stood dismounted beside him,
litter and mules and Will on the sumpter horse having
all stopped in the lee of a green bank disked with
primroses. Master Hardwick made signs for the
physician to stoop. “Eh, kinsman,” he whispered.
“You and I are the only Aderholds in this part of the
world. And you are a good leech—a good leech!
Would you stay at the Oak Grange for your lodging,
man? I’ve no money—no money at all—but I’d
<i>lodge</i> you—”</p>

<p>The miles decreased between the cavalcade and
the village. Aderhold was riding now alone, Carthew
still ahead, and Will fallen back with the litter.
Looking about him, the physician found something
very rich and fair in the day and the landscape. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for a long time had he had such a feeling of health
and moving peace, a feeling that contained neither
fever nor exhaustion. There was a sense of clarity,
strength, and fineness; moreover, the scene itself
seemed to exhibit something unusual, to have a
strangeness of beauty, a richness, a quality as of a
picture where everything is ordered and heightened.
It had come about before, this certain sudden interfusion,
or permeation, or intensity of realization,
when all objects had taken on a depth and glow,
lucidity, beauty, and meaning. The countryside
before him was for an appreciable moment transfigured.
He saw it a world very lovely, very rich.
It was noble and good in his eyes—it was the
dear Earth as she might always be.... The glow
went as it had come, and there lay before him only
a fair, wooded English countryside, sun and shadow
and the April day.</p>

<p>He saw the village clearly now, with a sailing of
birds about the church tower. Carthew, who had
kept steadily ahead, occupied apparently with his
own meditations, checked his horse and waited until
the other came up with him, then touched the roan
with his whip and he and the physician went on
together.</p>

<p>There was something about this young man that
both interested and repelled. He was good-looking
and apparently intelligent. Silence itself was no bar
to liking, often it was quite the reverse. But Carthew’s
was no friendly and flowing quiet. His silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
had a harsh and pent quality. He looked often like a
man in a dream, but the dream had in it no suavity,
but appeared to contemplate high and stern and
dreadful things. Aderhold looked instinctively first
at a man’s eyes. Carthew’s eyes were earnest and
intolerant. In the lower part of his face there was
something that spoke of passions sunken, covered
over, and weighted down.</p>

<p>The two rode some little distance without speaking,
then Carthew opened his lips abruptly. “How
do you like this country?”</p>

<p>“I like it well,” said Aderhold. “It is a fair
country.”</p>

<p>“Fair and unfair,” answered the other. “It rests
like every other region under the primal Curse—The
old man, back there, has taken a fancy to you
and calls you his kinsman. Do you expect to bide at
the Oak Grange?”</p>

<p>“I think it truth that I am his kinsman,” answered
Aderhold. “For the other—I do not
know.”</p>

<p>“He is misliked hereabouts,” said Carthew. “He
is old and miserly. Those who have goods and gear
like him not because he will not spend with them,
and those who have none like him not because he
gives nothing. The Oak Grange is a ruinous place.”</p>

<p>The village now opened before them, a considerable
cluster of houses, most of them small and poor,
climbing a low hill and spreading over a bit of
meadow. The houses were huddled together, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they enclosed a village green and here and there rose
old trees, or showed a tiny garden. At the farther
end, on the higher ground, the church lifted itself,
dominating. Beyond it ran the highway still. The
landscape was fair, with hill and dale, and to the
right, against the horizon, violet-hued and misty, an
old forest.</p>

<p>Aderhold looked somewhat wistfully at the scene
before him. He had passed through much of harm
and peril. Body and mind he wanted rest, quiet
routine, for a time some ease. “It looks a place
where peace might be found,” he said.</p>

<p>“Five years ago,” said Carthew, “we had the
sweating sickness. Many died. Then all saw the
shadow from the lifted Hand.”</p>

<p>“It is wholesome now?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” answered the other, “until sin and denial
again bring bodily grief.”</p>

<p>Aderhold glanced aside at his companion. The latter
was riding with a stern and elevated countenance,
his lips moving slightly. The physician knew that
look no less than he had known the serving-man’s.</p>

<p>“Is it not,” demanded Carthew, “is it not marvellous
how the whole Creation groaneth and travaileth
with the knowledge of her doom! How contemptible
and evil is this world! Yet here we are sifted
out—and not the wise man of old, nor the heathen,
nor the ignorant, nor the child in his cradle is excused!
Is it not marvellous how, under our very
feet, men and women and babes are burning in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
hell! How, for Adam’s sin, all perish save only the
baptized believer—and he is saved in no wise of his
own effort and merit, but only of another’s! How
God electeth the very damned—and yet is their
guilt no whit the less! Is it not marvellous!”</p>

<p>“Aye, fabulously marvellous,” said Aderhold.</p>

<p>“The sense of sin!” pursued Carthew. “How it
presses hard upon my heart! The sense of sin!”</p>

<p>Aderhold was silent. He possessed a vivid enough
realization of his many and recurring mistakes and
weaknesses, but, in the other’s meaning, he had no
sense of sin.</p>

<p>They came to the village and rode through it, the
litter arousing curiosity, allayed every few yards by
Will’s statements. Aderhold observed the lack of
any sympathy with the sick old man, even the growling
note with which some of the people turned aside.
There was the usual village traffic in the crooked
street, the small shops and the doorways. Children
were marching with the geese upon the green, where
there was a pond, and near it the village stocks.
Housewives, with tucked-up skirts and with pattens,—for
an April shower had made mire of the ways,—clattered
to and fro or sat spinning by window or
door. Many of the men were in the fields, but there
were left those who traded or were mechanic, as well
as the aged, sitting, half-awake, half-asleep, in
sunny spots. It was the usual village of the time,
poor enough, far from clean, ignorant and full of
talk, and yet not without its small share of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
then counted for human flower and fruition, nor
without promise of the future’s flower and fruition.</p>

<p>They rode by the church, set in dark yews.
Almost in its shadow rose a plain stone house.
“Master Thomas Clement, the minister’s,” said
Carthew. “Hawthorn hath a godly and zealous pastor!
The town behind us is all for prelates and vestments
and a full half at least of the old superstitions.
But Hawthorn and the country to the north have
purged themselves as far as they safely may.”</p>

<p>Out upon the open road again they saw to the left,
back among trees upon a low hilltop, a large and
well-built house. “Carthew House,” said Carthew,
“where I live. But I think that I will ride on with
you to the Oak Grange.”</p>

<p>Presently, leaving the highway, they took a rough
and narrow road that led, first through fields and
then through uncultivated country, toward the
great wood that had been for some time visible.
“Hawthorn Forest,” said Carthew. They rode a
mile in silence, the wood growing darker and taller
until it reared itself immediately before them. To
the right, at some little distance from the road and
almost upon the edge of the forest, stood a thatch-roofed
cottage with a dooryard where, later, flowers
would bloom, and under the eaves a row of beehives.
“Heron’s cottage,” said Carthew. “Old Heron
lives there, who in the old times was clerk to
the steward of the castle.”</p>

<p>They entered the wood. It was dark and old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
parts of it not having been cut since Saxon times.
Their road, which was now hardly more than a cart
track, crossed but an angle, the Oak Grange lying
beyond in open country. But for some minutes they
were sunk in a wilderness of old trees, with a
spongy, leaf-thickened earth beneath the horses’
hoofs. The sunshine fell shattered through an interlacing
of boughs just beginning to take on a hue of
spring. Every vista closed in a vaporous blue.</p>

<p>A woman was gathering faggots in the wood. As
they came nearer she straightened herself and stood,
watching them. She was young and tall, grey-eyed,
and with braided hair the colour of ripe wheat.
“Heron’s daughter,” said Carthew when they had
passed. “She should cover her hair like other women
with a cap. It is not seemly to wear it so, in
braids that shine.”</p>

<p>They were presently forth from the forest; before
them a stretch of fields no longer well husbanded, a
stream murmuring among stones, a bit of orchard,
and an old, dilapidated dwelling, better than a farm
house, less than a manor house, all crusted with lichen
and bunched with ivy. A little removed stood the
huge old granary that had given the place its name,
but it, too, looked forlorn, ruinous, and empty.
“The Oak Grange,” said Carthew. “People say that
once it was a great haunt of elves and fairies, and
that they are yet seen of moonlight nights, dancing
around yonder oak. They dance—but every seven
years they pay a tithe of their company to hell.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE MAN WITH THE HAWK</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Aderhold</span> saw no fairies, though sometimes of
moonlight nights he pleased his fancy by bringing
them in his mind’s eye in a ring around the oak.
Hours—days—weeks passed, and still he abode
at the Oak Grange.</p>

<p>Together he and Master Hardwick had gone over
an ancient record. There was the Aderhold line,
intertwining with the Hardwick. The blood-tie was
not close, but it was there. Back in the reign of the
sixth Henry they found a common ancestor in one
Gilbertus Aderhold, slain on Bosworth Field. The
blood-warmth was between them. Moreover, the
old man had turned with a strong liking to this
present Aderhold, and besides all there was his fear
of illness and death. How well to have a leech
always at hand! At last it came to “Will you live
here for your roof and keep? I could not give you
money—no, no! I have no money to give.”</p>

<p>Refuge—security—here in this silent place,
behind the great screen of Hawthorn Wood....
Aderhold stayed and was glad to stay, and served
the old man well for his keep. The region grew to
know that here was old Master Hardwick’s kinsman,
brought with him when he came back from London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to live with him and doubtless become his heir. He
was a leech. Goodman Cole, living by the forest, fell
ill of a racking cough and a burning fever, sent for
the doctor at the Grange, was swiftly better, and
sang the leech’s praises. As time wore on he began
to be sent for here and there, chiefly to poor people’s
houses. Eventually he doctored many of such
people, now in the village, now in the country roundabout.
Few of the well-to-do employed him; they
sent to the town for a physician of name. He asked
little money for his services; he did not press the
poor for payment, and often as not remitted the
whole. He earned enough to keep him clad, now and
then to purchase him a book.</p>

<p>He soon came to the conclusion that whatever
store of gold Master Hardwick might once have had,
it was now a dwindling store. In whatever secret
place in his gaunt, bare room the old man kept his
wealth, he was, Aderhold thought, nearing the bottom
layer. There was a rueful truth in the anxiety
with which he regarded even the smallest piece of
either metal he must produce and part with. And if,
at the Oak Grange, there was little of outgo, there
was still less of income. The land which went with
the Grange was poor and poorly tilled. There was a
cot or two with tenants, dulled labourers, dully
labouring. Mostly they paid their rent in kind. He
heard it said that in his middle life Master Hardwick
had ventured with some voyage or other to the
Indies, and had received in increase twenty times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
his venture. If so, he thought that his venture must
have been but small.</p>

<p>Master Hardwick kept but the one man, Will the
smith’s son, who did not sleep at the Grange, but
came each morning and cared for the horse and the
cow and the garden. Within doors there was old
Dorothy, who cooked and cleaned, and, now in and
now out, there strayed a lank, shy, tousle-headed
boy, her nephew. The old house was dim and still,
as out of the world as a house may be. Master Hardwick
rarely stirred abroad. There was in truth a lack
of health. The physician thought that the old man
had not many years to live. Aderhold set himself
with a steady kindness to doing what could be done,
to giving sympathy and understanding, and when
the old man wished it, companionship. Sitting in
the dim house with him, facing him at table over
their scant and simple fare, listening to his brief talk,
the physician came to find, beneath a hard and repellent
exterior, something sound enough, an honesty
and plain-dealing. And Master Hardwick, with
a hidden need both to feel and receive affection,
turned and clung to the younger man.</p>

<p>Visitors of any nature rarely came to the Oak
Grange. The place was as retired as though fernseed
had been sprinkled about and the world really
could not see it. Once, during this early summer,
Harry Carthew came, riding across the stream upon
his great roan. But this day Aderhold was away, one
of the tenants breaking a leg and a small child being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sent wailing with the news to the Grange. And Master
Thomas Clement came, alike afresh to reason
with the miser and to view this new parishioner.</p>

<p>Aderhold saw him cross the stream by the footbridge
and come on beneath the fairy oak. He knew
who it was, and he had time to map his course. He
had made up his mind—he was worn and weary
and buffeted, he was now for peace and quiet living.
He tied a millstone around the neck of the Gilbert
Aderhold of Paris and sank him deep, deep! The
minister stayed no great while and directed most of
his discourse toward Master Hardwick. When he
turned to Aderhold, the latter said little, listened
much, answered circumspectly, and endued himself
with an agreeing inclination of the head and an air of
grave respect. When the minister was gone, he went
and lay beneath the fairy oak, in the spangly twilight,
his head buried in his arms.</p>

<p>The next Sunday he went to church and sat with a
still face, watching the sands run from the pulpit
glass. There were facts about the region which he
had gathered. The town a few miles away with the
earl’s seat above it was prelatical and all for “superstitious
usages.” The country between town and
village might be called debatable ground. But
Hawthorn Village and the region to the north of it
might have been approved by Calvin or by Knox.</p>

<p>Sitting far back, in the bare, whitewashed church,
he remarked men and women truly happy in their
religion, men and women who showed zeal if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
happiness, men and women who wore zeal because
it was the fashionable garment, men and women,
born followers, who trooped behind zeal in others,
and uttered war-cries in a language not their own.
In the pulpit there was flaming zeal. The sermon
dealt with miracles and prodigies, with the localities
of heaven and hell, with Death and the Judgement—Death
that entered the world five thousand
and six hundred and odd years ago. “For before
that time, my hearers, neither man nor animal nor
flower nor herb died!”</p>

<p>Aderhold walked that summer far and wide, learning
the countryside. Now he wandered in deep
woods, now he climbed the hills and looked upon the
fair landscape shining away, now he entered leafy,
hidden vales, or traced some stream upward to its
source, or downward to the murmur of wider waters.
Several times he walked to the town. Here was a
bookshop, where, if he could not buy, he could yet
stand awhile and read.... He loved the view of this
town with the winding river and the bridge, and
above the climbing streets the old castle and the
castle wood. He liked to wander in its streets and to
mark the mellow light upon its houses. Now and
then he went into the great church where the light
fell through stained glass and lay athwart old pillars.
Once he found himself here, sitting in the shadow of
a pillar, when people began to enter. Some especial
service was to be held, he knew not wherefore. The
organ rolled and he sat where he was, for he loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
music. There was a sermon, and it was directed
against Puritan and Presbyterian, and more especially
against that taint of Republicanism which
clung to their Geneva cloaks. No such imputation
breathed against the surplice. <i>The Divine Right of
Kings.</i>—<i>The duty of Passive Obedience.</i>—<i>Authority!
Authority! Authority!</i> It rolled through the church,
boomed forth with passion.</p>

<p>Aderhold, coming out into the sunshine, walked
through the town and found himself upon the London
road. It was high summer, the sun yet far aloft,
and when it sank the round pearl of the moon would
rise. He had not before walked upon this road. An
interest stirred within him to view the country toward
the Rose Tavern, travelled through in the darkness
that night. He left the town behind him and
walked southward. Between two and three miles
out, he saw before him a little rise in the road, and
crowning it, a gibbet with some bones and shrivelled
flesh swinging in the chains. It was nothing uncommon;
he had seen in France a weary number of such
signposts, and on this great road, coming north from
London, he had twice passed such a thing. It was so
fair and soft a summer’s day, the gauzy air filled
with dancing sunbeams, the sky a melting blue—the
very upright and cross of the gibbet faded into it
and seemed robbed of horror. Indeed, long usage
had to the eyes of most robbed it of frightfulness at
any hour, unless it was in the dead of night when the
chains creaked, creaked, and something sighed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The traffic of the road went talking and jesting by,
with hardly a glance aside at the arm across the
sky.</p>

<p>Aderhold sat down upon the opposite bank, amid
fern and foxglove, and with his chin in his hand
regarded the gibbet. Now and again man and beast
passed, but they paid no attention to the dusty,
seated figure. For the greater while the road lay
bare. He gazed, dreaming, and through the mists of
time he seemed to see Judea....</p>

<p>At last he spoke. “Carpenter of Nazareth! Man
as we are men, but a Prince in the house of Moral
Genius! Born with thy heritage, also, of an ancient,
savage faith, in thine ears, still, old saws of doom,
on thy lips at times hard sayings of that elder
world, in thy mind, yet unresolved, more than one
of the ancient riddles.... But thou thyself, through
all the realm of thy being, rising into the clearer
light, lifting where we all shall lift one day, transfiguring
life!... Genius and Golden Heart and Pure
Courage and Immortal Love.... Condemned by a
Church, handed over by it to the secular arm, gone
forth to thy martyr’s death—and still, Sage and
Seer! misunderstood and persecuted,—and still thou
standest with the martyrs ... slain afresh by many,
and not least by those who call themselves thine.
Wisdom, freedom, love.... Love—Love—Love!”</p>

<p>The fox-gloves nodded around him. He drew
toward him a long stem and softly touched, one by
one, the purple bells. “Freedom—love!... Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
flower! When shall we see how thou flowest into
me and I into thee?”</p>

<p>He let the purple stem swing back, and with his
hands about his knees again regarded the gibbet;
then, when some minutes had gone by, rose and pursued
his way. Another half-hour and he came to a
place where three roads met. A passing shepherd
boy told him the name was Heron’s Cross-Roads.
It was a lonely place, wold and stunted wood, and in
an angle, amid heath and briar, was set a blackened
stake. Aderhold went across to it. In the wood was
a rudely cut name, with a word or two below; the
stake was set through the heart of a suicide. Nettles
were about it, and some one passing had thrown an
empty and broken jug of earthenware. It lay in
shards. Aderhold knelt, gathered them together,
and rising, laid the heap beneath the hedge.</p>

<p>Back upon the highway, he turned his face again
to the town. It was a long way to the Oak Grange,
and Master Hardwick was concerned if the house
were not closed and fast at a most early hour.
<i>Heron’s Cross-Roads.</i> As Aderhold walked an association
arose with the name. Heron—that was the
name of the old man who owned the cottage on the
edge of Hawthorn Forest. He was not there now;
the cottage had been shut up and tenantless since
early summer. He and his daughter were gone, Will
had told him, on a long visit to the old man’s brother,
the earl’s huntsman who lived in the castle wood
above the town. No one knew when they would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
back. Most of their furnishings and household things
had been loaned here or there. The dairy woman
had taken their cow, some one else the beehives.
Heron! He had a moment’s drifting vision of the
girl gathering faggots in the forest. It passed and
the present day and landscape took its place. Soon
he came again to the rise of ground and the gibbet
so stark against the blue. He hesitated, then
paused, resting as he had rested before upon a stone
sunk in the wayside growth.</p>

<p>A horse and rider emerged with suddenness from a
sunken lane upon his left, and stood still in the middle
of the road—a fine horse, and a fine, richly
dressed rider, a man of thirty-five with a hawk upon
his gauntleted fist. Turning in the saddle he looked
about him, and espying Aderhold where he sat,
called to him.</p>

<p>“Hey, friend! Have the earl and his train passed
this way?”</p>

<p>“I have not seen them, sir.”</p>

<p>The other glanced around again, then beckoned
with an easy command. Aderhold rose and went to
him, to find that he was wanted to hold the hooded
falcon while the horseman waited for the hawking
party from which some accident had separated him.
Aderhold took the peregrine from the other’s wrist
and stood stroking softly with one finger the blue-black
plumage. The rider rose in his stirrups,
swept the horizon with his eye, and settled back.
“Dust in the distance.” His voice went with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
looks—he seemed a rich and various person, who
could show both caprice and steadfastness. Now he
glanced downward at Aderhold. “Ha, I had not
observed you before!—A travelling scholar?”</p>

<p>“A travelling physician, an it please you,” said
Aderhold, smoothing the bird with his finger, “biding
at present at the Oak Grange, beyond Hawthorn
Village.”</p>

<p>“You take,” said the horseman with a glance at
the gibbet, “a merry signpost to rest beneath!”</p>

<p>“It is neither merry nor dismal,” said Aderhold,
“but a subject for thought. That which swung
there swings there now—though shrunken and
dark and answering to no lust of the eye. But that
which never swung there swings there now neither.
I trouble it not. It is away from here.”</p>

<p>The other swung himself from his saddle. “I had
rather philosophize than eat, drink, or go hawking—and
philosophers are most rare in this region!”
He took his seat upon a heap of stones, while his
horse beside him fell to grazing. “Come, sit and talk,
travelling scholar!—That fellow on the gibbet—that
small, cognized part of him that was hanged, as
you would say. Being hungry, he slew a deer for his
own use, then violently resisted and wounded those
sent to his hut to take him, and finally, in court he
miserably defamed and maligned the laws of the
land and the judge in his chair. So there he swings
for an example to stealers of deer and resisters of
constables, to say naught of blasphemers of procedure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and churls to magistrates!... What is your
opinion, travelling scholar, of Authority?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Aderhold, “what is yours?”</p>

<p>The other laughed. “Mine, Sir Prudence?—Well,
at times I have thought this and at times that.
Once or twice a head like Roger Bacon’s has spoken.
‘The swollen stream forgets its source, and the overweening
son turns and with his knotted and sinewy
hands chokes his mother that bore him.’”</p>

<p>“It is a good parable,” said Aderhold. “I trust
that your worship, being obviously of those in
authority, will often listen to that brazen head!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” answered the other. “I am of that camp
and not of it. My brazen head will yet get me into
trouble!” He sat regarding the mound opposite, the
tall upright and arm, the creaking chain, and the
shapeless thing, now small, for most of the bones
had fallen, which swung and dangled. “And,
friend, what do you think of this matter of the
Golden Age, man’s perfection, Paradise, the friendship
of angels and all wisdom and happiness lying,
in the history of this orb, <i>behind</i> us?”</p>

<p>“If it were so,” said Aderhold, “then were it well
to walk backwards.”</p>

<p>“So saith my brazen head!—Hark!”</p>

<p>It was a horn winding at no great distance. There
came a sound of approaching horsemen, of voices
and laughter. The waiting cavalier rose to his feet,
caught his horse by the bridle and mounted. Aderhold
gave him back the falcon. The earl and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
train, a dozen in all, gentlemen, falconers, and
grooms, coming across the fields, leaped the hedge
and crowded into the road, gathering into their
number the rider with the hawk. Aderhold heard
him named as “Sir Richard.” He waved his hand
to the physician—all rode away with a flash of
colour and a blare of sound. A few moments, and
there was only the bare highway, the little rise of
ground, and the gibbet with its outstretched arm
against the blue and serene sky.</p>

<p>Aderhold, keeping on to the town, passed along
its bustling high street, and down the steep slope,
beneath the shadow of the great church and the
castle in its woods above, to the river and its many-arched,
ancient bridge. Before him lay the fair
country between the town and Hawthorn village.
He travelled through it in the late, golden light, and
at sunset came into Hawthorn. Children were playing
and calling in the one street and several lanes,
on the green, by the pond, and the village stocks.
The ale-house had its custom, but, as he presently
saw, most of the inhabitants of Hawthorn were
gathered in a buzzing cluster before the church. A
post, riding from London north, had passed through
the village and left behind a dole of news. Among
his items, principal to Hawthorn was this: The
King, they say, will presently of his good pleasure,
lighten the pains and penalties now imposed upon
Papists.</p>

<p>Aderhold, touching the fringe of the crowd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
caught a glimpse of Master Clement, standing upon
the church steps, haranguing. He caught the words,
“The Scarlet Woman ... Babylon ... Lighten?
Rather double and treble and quadruple—” Near
the minister he saw Harry Carthew. He did not
pause; he went by like a moth in the dusk. As the
moon rose he came to the stream before the Grange,
crossed it by the footbridge, and went on beneath
the fairy oak to the house where one candle shone
from a single window. In the middle of the night
he was wakened by some one calling and throwing
pebbles against his casement. The miller, a mile
down the stream, was ill and groaning for the leech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">JOAN</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was May three years since Joan had smelled the
apple tree in blossom by the well, or had marked
the heartsease amid the grass. She drew her bucket
of water, flashing, dripping, and cold, rested it upon
the well-stone, and regarded with grey eyes the
cottage and its handbreadth of garden.</p>

<p>She sighed. There had been much of advantage
in that long sojourn with her uncle the huntsman, in
his better house than this, a mile in the castle wood,
above the town so much greater than Hawthorn
Village! There had been the town to walk to, the
bright things to see, the bustle in the streets, the
music in the church, the occasional processions and
pageants, the fairs and feast days. For the castle
itself, the great family was not often there, but
the housekeeper had been friendly to her, and she
had been let to roam as she pleased through the
place, half-mediæval stronghold, half new walls and
chambers echoing Tudor luxury. Four times in the
three years the family had been in residence, and
then there were other things to watch, though at a
most respectful distance!... Once there had been
a masque in the park, and, as many figures were
needed, there had come an order from the countess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
A page had brought it, and had explained in detail,
what was wanted. There was to be a whole pageant
of scenes from the mythology. She was to enact a
virgin who had been very swift of foot—she was to
run swiftly from north to south across the great
pleasaunce—a young gentleman, who would be
running likewise, would throw before her, one after
the other, three yellow apples. She would stoop and
pick them up while he ran on. She nodded. “Yes, I
know. Atalanta.” The page, who was younger than
herself but comely and court-bred, evinced surprise.
“Wherever, Phyllis, didst get that learning?” She
said that her father was clerkly and talked to her of
things in books.... The masque! It was a world
to remember, the masque! How beautiful all things
had been, and everybody—and kind! But there
had never been but the one masque, and soon the
family had gone away.</p>

<p>She was thinking, as she stood by the well, that
now perhaps they would come back this May and
she would not be there. She drew a long sigh, and
missed the castle, the park and the wood, the town
and the sight of the river and the bridge, over which
something was always passing. She missed, too, her
uncle the huntsman, who had died; missed his
larger house and the greater coming and going;
missed her room, where, standing at her window, she
saw the moon rise behind the Black Tower. And
now her uncle was dead who had been a single man,
and who had kept them from month to month and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
year to year with his loud protest each time they
talked of lifting a burden and going back to Hawthorn
Forest.... But he was dead, and his house
passed to the new huntsman. Joan and her father
loaded their clothes and such matters upon a cart,
mounted it themselves, and with some farewells to
castle neighbours took the road to their own small
cottage, miles away.</p>

<p>She sighed, but then, with her eyes upon the
heartsease, determined to make the best of it. It
was not as though she did not love the cottage and
the garden, where presently all the flowers would
bloom again, and Hawthorn Forest, where she had
wandered freely from childhood. She did love them,
she had a warm love for them; and sometimes at her
uncle’s she had pleased herself with being pensive
and missing them sadly. She loved her father, too;
the old clerk and she were good friends, so good
friends, in an age of parental severity and filial awe,
as to have scandalized the housekeeper at the
castle. Moreover, though they were poor and had
always lived so retired, and though the country
hereabouts afforded few neighbours, and though she
had never known many people in the village, having
been but a young maid when she went away, there
were those whom she remembered, and she looked
forward to a renewal of acquaintance. And the day
was very rich and fair, and a robin singing, and
waves of fragrance blowing from the fruit trees, and
she was young and strong and innately joyous. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
broke a branch of apple blossom and stuck it into
the well water; she stooped and plucked a knot of
heartsease and fastened it at her bodice throat.
Then she lifted the bucket to her head, and moved
with it, tall and steady, over the worn stones of the
path to the cottage door.</p>

<p>Arrived within, she fell to her baking, in a clean
kitchen with doors and windows wide. She was a
notable cook, her mother having trained her before
she died. Moreover, what she touched she touched
like an artist. She made no useless steps or movements,
she neither dallied nor hurried; all went with
a fine assurance, an easy “Long ago I knew how—but
if you ask me <i>how</i> I know—!” She sang as she
worked, a brave young carolling of Allan-à-Dale and
John-à-Green and Robin Hood and Maid Marian.</p>

<p>The good odour of the bread arose and floated out
to mingle with the maytime of the little garden.
Old Roger Heron, short, ruddy, and hale for all he
was so clerkly, came in from his spading. “That
smells finely!” he said. He dipped a cup into the
well water and drank.</p>

<p>“Aye, and it is going to taste finely!” answered
Joan.</p>

<p class="pp6sq p1">“‘I have heard talk of bold Robin Hood,</p>
<p class="pp8">And of brave Little John,</p>
<p class="pp6">Of Friar Tuck and Will Scarlet,</p>
<p class="pp8">Locksley and Maid Marian—’”</p>

<p class="p1">Her father put down the cup, moved to the settle,
and sitting deliberately down, began with deliberation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
one of his talks of a thinking man. “Look you,
Joan! Goodman Cole and I have been discoursing.
We were talking of religion.”</p>

<p>“Aye?” said Joan. She spread a white cloth upon
the table and set in the midst a bow-pot of cherry
bloom. “Religion. Well?”</p>

<p>“You should say the word with a heavier tone,”
said old Roger. “‘Religion.’—Things aren’t here
as they were at your uncle’s—rest his soul! Modesty
in religion and a decent mirth seemed right
enough, seeing that the earl was minded that way
and on the whole the town as well. So the old games
and songs and ways went somehow on—though
everything was stiffening, even there, and not like
it was when I was young and the learned were talking
of the Greeks. But times have changed! It
seems the Lord wishes gloom, or the minister says he
does. If it was begun to be felt in the castle and the
town, and it was,—your uncle and I often talked
about it,—it shows ten times more here. Aye, it
showed three years ago, but Goodman Cole says it
grows day by day, and that now if you appear not
with a holy melancholy you are little else than a
lost soul!”</p>

<p>“‘Holy melancholy’ and ‘lost souls,’” said Joan.
“I know not why it is that those words together
sound to me so foolish.—Doth it help anything
when I am sad?”</p>

<p class="pp6sq p1">“‘—Friar Tuck and Will Scarlet,</p>
<p class="pp8">Locksley and Maid Marian—’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“Stop, child!” said old Roger. “I’m in earnest
and so must you be. Look you, Joan! you’re all I’ve
got, and folk will be fanciful about all they’ve
got and try to guard it all around. And it came
into my head while Goodman Cole was talking—and
it was he who put it there, talking of your
looks, and saying that you had better go mim-mouth
to church, and that you had a strange way of looking
straight at a body when you spoke, which didn’t
become a woman, who ought always to go with a
downcast look—it came into my head, I say, that
we’re poor and without any protector and fairly
strange here now, and how evil tongues are as common
as grass, and I said to myself that I’d give you
a good cautioning—”</p>

<p>“Mim-mouth and downcast look and go to heaven
so!” said Joan. “I wonder what that heaven’s
like!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t talk that way,” said old Heron.
“No, I know, you don’t do so when others are by, but
you’ll forget sometime. Mistress Borrow at the
castle said that you were a very pagan, though an
innocent one! That came into my head, too, while
he talked. And another thing came that sounds
fanciful—but a myriad of women and girls have
found it no fancy! Listen to me, Joan. Since
we got our new King, and since the land has grown
so zealous and finds Satan at any neighbour’s hearth,
there’s been a growing ferreting out and hanging
of witches. In Scotland it’s a fever and a running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
fire and we’re not as far as the antipodes from Scotland.
Now I’m not denying that there are witches;
the Bible says there are, and so, of course, there
must be. But it knocks at my head that many a
silly old woman and many a young maid has been
called a witch that was none! And it came to me
that Hawthorn’s not the castle and the castle wood,
and that if Mistress Borrow called you pagan and
said that you stepped and spoke too freely for a
woman, it’s like that some here might take it on
themselves to think pure ill—”</p>

<p>“I see not how they could,” said Joan. “There is
no ill to think.—Do you mean that I am not to
sing about Robin Hood and Maid Marian?”</p>

<p>“I like to hear you,” said old Roger; “but aren’t
there godly hymns? Use your own good sense, my
girl.”</p>

<p>Joan at the window looked out upon the flowering
trees and the springing grass and robin redbreast
carolling in the pear tree. When she turned her eyes
were misty. “I like to sing what I feel like singing.
If it chances to be a hymn, well and good—but a
forced hymn, meseems, is a fearful thing! I like to
go free, and I like not a mim-mouth and a downward
look. But I like not to bring trouble on you, and I
do not like either to have them set upon me for
ungodliness, nor to have some fool cry upon me for
a witch! So I’ll be careful. I promise you.” She laid
the trenchers upon the table and turned out from its
pan a warm and fragrant loaf. “I’ll be careful—oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
careful!—And now when are we going to get
our beehives from the forester’s wife?”</p>

<p>That afternoon she took her distaff and sat in the
doorway and span. The cottage stood some distance
from Hawthorn Forest road, but there was a
narrow greened-over path that wound between.
The robin sang lustily; daffodils, edging the walk to
the gate, were opening their golden cups. Old
Heron had gone a mile to engage Hugh the thatcher
to come to-morrow to mend the roof. Joan span and
span and thought of the castle and the masque.</p>

<p>An hour passed. The gate-latch clicked and she
looked up. An old woman, much bent and helping
herself with a knobby stick, was coming toward
her between the rows of daffodils. When she reached
the doorstone Joan saw how wrinkled and drear were
her face and form. “Good-day,” she said in a
quavering voice.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” answered Joan.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” said the old woman again. “You
don’t remember me, but I remember you, my pretty
maid! I mind you running about in the woods,
playing as it were with your shadow, with your hair
braided down! Now you wear it under a cap as is
proper. I’m Mother Spuraway, who lives beyond
the mill-race.”</p>

<p>“I remember now,” said Joan. “I had forgotten.
Will you sit down?”</p>

<p>She brought a stool and set it for her visitor. The
other lowered herself stiffly. “Oh, my old bones!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
I’ll sit for a minute, sweetheart, but what I wanted
to ask you—” She took Joan by the apron and
held her with shaking fingers. “I wanted to ask you
if you wouldn’t be Christian enough to spare me a
measure of meal? I’ll swear by the church door and
the book of prayer that I haven’t had bite nor sup
since this time yesterday!” She fell to whimpering.</p>

<p>Joan stood, considering her with grey eyes. “Yes,
I’ll give you some meal. But what! They used to
say that you were well-to-do.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye!” said Mother Spuraway. “They said
sooth. I didn’t lack baked nor brewed, no, nor
silver sixpences!—for, look you, I knew all the good
herbs. But alack, alack! times are changed with
me.... I’m hungry, I’m hungry, and my gown’s
ragged that once was good and fine, and my shoes
are not fit to go to church in. Woe’s me—woe’s
me—woe’s me!”</p>

<p>Joan went indoors and returned with a piece of
bread and a cup of milk. Mother Spuraway seized
them and ate and drank with feeble avidity. “Good
maid—a good maid!”</p>

<p>“Why do they come to you no more?” asked
Joan.</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway put down the empty cup.
“Partly, there’s a leech come to these parts has
stolen my trade. I’ll not say he doesn’t know the
herbs, too, but I knew them as well as he, and I knew
them first! But mostly, oh, dear heart! because
there’s been raised a hue and cry that I didn’t cure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
with innocence—as though I didn’t cure as innocently
as him! But I’m old—I’m old!... I never
had aught to do even with white magic. There
was healing in the herbs and that and good sense
was enough. But I’m old—old, and they bear
hard upon women.... And I hear that there’s a
buzz of talk and I may be taken up. I know Master
Clement’s been against me since ever he came
to the parish—” She began to weep, painful slow
tears of age.</p>

<p>Joan looked at her with a knitted brow. “There,
mother, there, mother! I would not let them that
hurt me make me weep. See! I’ll give you your
meal, and it will all come straight.” She brought
her a full measure, and a great share of her baking
of bread besides.</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway blessed her for a pitiful maid,
got painfully to her feet, and said she would be going.
“You’ve good herbs in your garden, but I
see no rue. If I be straying this way again I’ll bring
you a bit for planting.”</p>

<p>She went away, her stick supporting her, her eyes
still searching the little leaves and low plants on each
side of the garden path and the faint, winding track
between gate and forest road. Joan, in the doorway,
let her distaff fall and sat pondering, her elbow
on her knee, her chin in her hand, and her grey eyes
upon the fruit trees. “Shall I tell father—or shall
I not tell father? If I tell him, he will say she must
not come again.... And how am I going to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
her coming again?” In the end, she determined to
tell her father, but to represent to him how hard it
was going to be—and how it seemed to her poor-spirited,
loveless, and mean—And as she got this
far, she saw another visitor coming.</p>

<p>She knew this visitor, and springing up, went to
the gate to greet her. Before she left this countryside
she had often, of Sundays in Hawthorn Church,
sat beside Alison Inch, the sempstress’s daughter.
And after she went to the castle Alison had twice
been with her mother to the town, and they had
climbed the hill to the castle wood and the huntsman’s
house to see their old neighbours, though,
indeed, they had not been such near neighbours.
Alison was older than she, but at the castle hers had
been the advantage, she being at home with a number
of goodly things, and Alison showing herself somewhat
shy and deferential. But now the castle and
the park and her uncle’s house were a dream, and
Joan was back in Heron’s cottage that was not on
the whole so good as the Inches’ nor so near the village.
Moreover, she was now almost a stranger, and
knowledge and familiarity with all matters were on
Alison’s side, to say nothing of her year or two
longer in the world. Alison felt her advantages, and
was not averse to the other’s recognition of them.
Joan and she kissed, then moved somewhat saunteringly
up the path to the doorstone.</p>

<p>“Mother and I went to take her new smocks to
Madam Carthew, and then when we came back it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was so fine, and mother said that she would go to see
Margery Herd, and if I chose I might walk on here.—The
place looks,” said Alison, “as though you
had never gone away.”</p>

<p>“Nay, there are things yet to do,” said Joan,
“and that though we’ve been here well-nigh a
month. You would not think how hard it is to get
back the gear we left with folk! They had the use
until we came back, and they knew that we would
come back—but now you might think that we
were asking their things instead of our own! Three
women have looked as black at me! We got our
churn but yesterday, and the forester’s wife still
has our beehives. A dozen of her own, and when we
ask for our poor three back again, you might suppose
we’d offered to steal the thatch from over her
head!”</p>

<p>They sat down, facing each other, on the sunflecked
doorstone.</p>

<p>Alison looked about her. “I’ve never seen daffodillies
bloom like these!—Joan, I heard a story on
thee the other day.”</p>

<p>“What story?”</p>

<p>“They said thou hadst a lover in the town—a
vintner.”</p>

<p>“I never had a lover, town or country.”</p>

<p>Alison made round eyes. “What! no one ever
asked you to wed?”</p>

<p>“I said not that. I said that I never had a
lover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Alison fell to plaiting her apron, her head on one
side. “Mother says that your father’s that sunk in
notions of the learned that he’d never think of it,
but she wonders that your uncle didn’t see fit to
find you a husband.”</p>

<p>“Does she? Well, one wonders over one thing and
one over another.”</p>

<p>“There are very few bachelors and marriageable
men hereabouts,” said Alison, “but I suppose you’ll
get that one of them you set your cap for.”</p>

<p>“And why do you suppose that?”</p>

<p>Alison, her head still on one side, looked aslant at
the returned friend. “Oh, men are all for strange
and new! Your tallness, now, that most people
count a fault, and that colour hair and that colour
eyes.... Yes, you’ll get the one you want.”</p>

<p>“And if I want none?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Alison, and laughed somewhat shrilly.
“Have you got an elfin man for your true-love?
You’ll not cheat me else with your ‘And if I want
none?’”</p>

<p>Joan twirled her distaff. “I do not wish to cheat
you.—And you went with the smocks to Madam
Carthew’s?”</p>

<p>Alison bent, slipped off her shoe, and shook out of
it a minute pebble. “And what do you mean by
that?”</p>

<p>“Mean? I mean naught,” said Joan. “I meant
that she was a great lady, and the squire’s house
must be fine to see. What didst think I meant?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>But Alison would not divulge. All that came was,
“<i>I</i> noted you last Sunday, how you looked aside,
during the singing, at the gentry in the squire’s pew!
But they are godly people, and if you think that <i>they</i>
looked aside—”</p>

<p>“In God’s name!” said Joan, “what is the matter
with the wench?”</p>

<p>But before she could find that out, here came one
back—Mother Spuraway, to wit. She came hobbling
up the green path to the gate, and stood beckoning.
Joan rose and went to her. Mother Spuraway
held in her hand a green herb taken up by the
root with earth clinging to it.</p>

<p>“It is rue, dearie,” she said. “There was a clump
of it left by the burned cot a little way off. So I dug
it up for you—”</p>

<p>Joan took it. “Thank you. I’ll plant it now.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got company,” said Mother Spuraway.
“I’ll not come in. But I wanted to do somewhat
for you—”</p>

<p>She turned and hobbled off, her wavering old
figure wavering away upon the twisting path.</p>

<p>Joan went back to the doorstone with the rue in
her hand.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that Mother Spuraway?” asked Alison.
“I wouldn’t be seen talking to her. She’s a
witch.”</p>

<p>“She’s no such thing,” said Joan. “She’s only a
wretched, poor old woman. Now, what did you
mean about Sunday and church?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>But her father came round the corner of the cottage,
bringing with him Hugh the thatcher to have a
look at the torn roof. Alison rose; the sun was getting
low and she must be going. She went, and
Joan, at that time, did not find out what she had
meant.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SQUIRE’S BROTHER</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Four</span> days later she went to walk in Hawthorn
Forest. It was a golden afternoon, and she had hastened
her work and got it out of hand. The roof was
mended, the beehives were back, the cottage taking
on an air of having been lived in all this while. Old
Heron earned by scrivener’s work. It was not much
that he found to do, but it gave them plain fare and
plain clothes to wear. Joan, too, from time to time
sold to a merchant flax that she had spun.... She
had gone no way into the forest since their return,
there had been each day so much to do! But to-day
an image had haunted her of how the forest used to
look in its garb of May.</p>

<p>She let the gate-latch fall behind her and went out
in the grey-green gown that she had spun and dyed
herself. She wore a small cap of linen and a linen
kerchief. Sunday she would wear a bluish gown, and
a cap and kerchief of lawn. She was tall and light
upon her feet, grey-eyed and well-featured, with hair
more gold than brown, with a warm, sun-flushed,
smooth, fine-textured skin, and a good mouth and
chin and throat. The sun was three hours high; she
meant to have a long and beautiful time.</p>

<p>So close to the forest edge was the cottage that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
almost immediately great trees were about her,
leaf-mould and flowerets beneath her feet. The forest
was hardly yet in full leaf. There spread about her
a divine pale emerald fretwork, and gold light in
lances and arrows, and closing the vistas purple light
in gauzy sheets and curtains. The boles of the
trees were marvels, the great spreading branches
kings’ wonders, every slight fern illustrious. The
stir and song of hidden birds, the scurrying of a hare,
a glimpse down a beechen aisle of a doe and fawn,
filled a cup of delight. She was Greek to it all, a
country girl of Attica. Merely to live was good,
merely to vibrate and quiver to the myriad straying
fingers of life, merely to be, and ever more to be, with
a fresh intensity!</p>

<p>On she wandered with a light step and heart, now
by some handbreadth of sward, now in a maze of
trees. Now and then she stood still, gazing and
listening and smelling the good earth. Once or twice
she rested upon some protruding root or fallen log,
nursed her knees and marked the minute life about
her.</p>

<p>Happy, happy, happy! with the blood coursing
warmly and sanely through her veins, with her senses
keen at the intake and her brain good at combining....
Open places, small clearings, existed here
and there in the forest with, at great intervals, some
hut or poor cottage. So it was that she soon came
in sight of the burned cot and trodden bit of garden
whence Mother Spuraway had plucked the rue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The place lay curiously, half in gold light, half in
deep shadow. The stone chimney was standing, together
with some portion of charred rafter. There
were currant and gooseberry bushes, and a plum
tree, but the bit of garden-hedge was broken down
and all things had run to waste. Joan, drawing near,
heard children’s voices, and presently, touching the
cleared space, came into view of six or seven village
boys, who, roaming at will or sent on some errand
through the wood, had found here a resting-stage
and fascination. They were after something—she
thought a bird’s nest—in a crotch of the plum tree
that brushed the blackened chimney. She stood and
watched for a moment, then called to them. “Leave
that poor bird alone!” Two or three, turning,
laughed and jeered, and one small savage at the foot
of the tree threw a stone. Joan was angry, but she
could not help the bird—they probably had nest
and eggs by now. She went on, past the burned cot,
and was presently in the greenwood again.</p>

<p>After a time she found herself upon the Oak
Grange road, running across this corner of the forest.
She had not meant to go this way, but a memory
came to her of a stream flowing over pebbles, of an
old house and an oak tree around which they used to
say the fairies danced at night. She walked on upon
the narrow and grass-grown road, and after a little
time it led her out of the wood and to the edge of the
pebbly stream. There was a footbridge thrown
across, but she did not mean to go over to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
bank. She had no acquaintance at the Grange. She
had heard Goodman Cole say that the old miser,
Master Hardwick, was still alive, but was rarely
seen without the house. Will the smith’s son had
once worked at the Grange, but she did not know if
he were there yet.... She sat down on a stone at
this end of the bridge, and regarded now the old
ruinous house sunk in ivy, with the long grass and
ragged shrubs before it, and now the giant oak where
the fairies danced, and now the bright blue sky
behind with floating clouds, and now the shallow,
narrow river with its pebbly shore, and now she
regarded all in one. <i>Ripple, ripple!</i> sang the water.</p>

<p>She sat there some time, but at last, with a long
breath, she stood up, looked a moment longer, then
turned and, reëntering the wood, faced homeward.
She had strolled and sauntered and spent her time.
Now the sun was getting low in the west. Presently
she left the road and took the forest track that
would bring her again by the burned cot.</p>

<p>Through the thinning wood she saw the place
before her, in shadow now, except that the top of
the plum tree was gold. She thought that she still
heard the boys’ voices. Then, just at the edge of the
clearing, she came suddenly face to face with a man.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, plainly dressed in some dark
stuff. Stopping as he did when he saw her, stepping
aside a pace to give her room, he chanced to come
into a ray of the last slant sunlight. It showed his
face, a lined, rather strange, not unpleasing face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
He was carrying in the hollow of his arm a grey and
white cat. The creature lay stretched out, half-dead,
blood upon its fur.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Joan, “it was that they were tormenting!”
She stood still. She was sympathetic
with animals; they were like everything else, living
and loving to live. She thought they were very like
human beings.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said the man. “But it can recover. It is
starved as well.” He looked at this chance-met
young woman. “I meant to carry it back to Dorothy
at the Grange,” he said. “But I am on my way
to visit a sick man and it will be much out of my
road. Do you live anywhere near?” He knit his
brows a little. He thought that by now he knew all
faces for a long way around, but he did not know her
face.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Joan. “I live at Heron’s cottage.—If
you wish me to, I’ll take her and give her milk to
drink and let her lie by the hearth for a while.”</p>

<p>They were standing beneath the very last line of
trees, before there began the bit of waste and the
ruined garden. The village boys were there yet,
turned—all but two of them—to some other idle
sport about the chimney and the fallen beams.
These two, loath to give up the beast they were tormenting,
and childishly wrathful against the intruder,
stood watching him from behind a thorn
bush.</p>

<p>“Will you do so?” said Aderhold. “That is well!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
I am going your way through the wood. I will carry
it until we reach the path to the cottage.”</p>

<p>They moved from the clearing and the sight of the
thorn bush. It was dim now in the wood, with an
evening wind and darkness stealing through. They
walked rather swiftly than slowly.</p>

<p>“I heard that Goodman Heron had come back,”
said Aderhold. “You are his daughter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m Joan.”</p>

<p>“You have been away a long time.”</p>

<p>“Aye. Three years come Saint John’s Eve.”</p>

<p>“Three years.—I have been here three years.”</p>

<p>“You are the physician?” asked Joan. “You live
at the Oak Grange with Master Hardwick?”</p>

<p>“Aye. At the Oak Grange.”</p>

<p>“They say that fairies dance there and that a
demon haunts it.”</p>

<p>“‘They say’ is the father and mother of delusion.”</p>

<p>“I would wish there were no demons,” said Joan,
“but some fairies are not ill folk. But the minister
saith that God hates all alike.”</p>

<p>They came to the edge of the forest, before them
the threadlike green path to Heron’s cottage. “I
must go on now by the road,” said Aderhold. Joan
held out her hands and he put in them the white and
grey cat. “You are a good maid to help me,” he
said. “I have little power to do aught for any one,
but if I can serve you ever I will.” He turned to the
road and the sick man, she to the cottage gate.</p>

<p>The next morning there came a visitor, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to Heron’s cottage, Master Harry Carthew, the
squire’s brother, who fastened his horse to the elm at
the gate, and came up the path between the daffodils
in his great boots and his sad-coloured doublet and
wide-brimmed hat. Joan, watching from the window,—her
father was just without and would meet
him,—thought how handsome a man he was, but
also how stern was his aspect, stern almost as if the
world were all a churchyard, with graves about....
It seemed that he had some writings that he wished
copied. As she moved about the kitchen she heard
his voice in explanation. The voice, she thought,
was like the gentleman, a well-made voice, and yet
hard, and yet melancholy, too. She heard him say
that he would ride by in a day or so for the writing—and
then he said that the day was warm and
asked for a cup of water.</p>

<p>Old Heron turned his head. “Joan!”</p>

<p>Joan filled a cup with fresh well water, set it on a
trencher for salver, and brought it forth to the
squire’s brother. He lifted it to his lips and drank.
Goodman Cole’s advice to the contrary, Joan stood
with a level gaze, with the result that she was aware
that as he drank he looked steadily at her over the
rim of the cup. It was not a free or distasteful look,
rather it had in it melancholy and wonder. He put
the cup down and presently went away.</p>

<p>Two days thereafter he came with other papers to
be copied. A pouring rain arrived upon his heels and
he must sit with old Heron in the kitchen until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
was over. The room was bright and clean. Joan,
having put for him her father’s chair, sat to one side
spinning; old Heron took a stool. They were yeoman
stock, and the squire’s brother was gentry. Carthew
spoke little and the others waited for him to speak.
The room was quiet save for the whirr of the wheel
and the rain without. The white and grey cat lay
by the hearth. Old Heron had thrown fresh faggots
on the fire, and the tongues of flame threw a dancing
light.</p>

<p>The little speech there was, and that solely between
the two men, fell upon the affairs of the country.
The discovery of the Gunpowder Plot was
seven months old, but England still echoed to the
stupendous noise it had made. Old Heron said
something that bore upon the now heavily penalized
state of the Catholics.</p>

<p>“Aye, they pulled down their own house on their
own heads!” answered Carthew. He spoke with a
stern, intense triumph. “I would have them forth
from England! There is warrant for it in all histories.
As the Spaniards pushed out the Jews, so
I would push them out!”</p>

<p>The rain stopped; he rose to go. Old Heron opening
the door, let in a burst of fresh sweetness. Joan
stood up from her wheel, and, as Carthew passed,
curtsied. He made an inclination of his head, their
eyes met. There was that in his look that both
challenged and besought, that, at all events, left her
troubled enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Again two days and he came to recover what was
copied. Again she sat and span, and again she was
conscious that he looked at her rather than at her
father, and that, though he spoke aloud only to her
father, there was some utterance trying to pierce its
way to her. He went away—but the next day he
came again, when there was no looking for him.</p>

<p>Her father was away to the village. She was at the
well, beneath the apple tree, by the heartsease bed.
She turned from lifting the cool, brimming, dripping
bucket, and saw him close beside her.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good-day, sir.—He is not here. Father is not
here!”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for that,” he answered; then, after
a silence in which she became aware that he was
fighting, she knew not why, for breath, “But you
are here.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Joan. “I—I have so much to do.”
She left the bucket on the coping of the well and
started toward the cottage. “Father went but a
little while ago. You may overtake him, sir,—”</p>

<p>Carthew stood before her. “I have seen you at
church three times. I have seen you here three
times. For years I had not thought of earthly toys—my
mind was set on the coming of the Kingdom
of God.... And now <i>you</i>—<i>you</i> come.... I think
you have bewitched me.”</p>

<p>Joan’s heart beat violently. A strong presence
was beside her, before her. She wrenched herself free.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
“You must not speak so, sir. You must not speak
so, Master Carthew! I am naught to you—you
can be naught to me.” Brushing by him, she began
to walk swiftly toward the cottage.</p>

<p>He kept beside her. “You are much to me—and
I will be much to you.... God knoweth the struggle,
and knoweth if I be damned or no!—But now
I will abide in this land that I believed not in—but
I will serve Him still; even where I am, I will serve
Him more strictly than before! So perhaps He will
accept, and not too dreadfully condemn.... Do not
doubt that I mean honestly by you.”</p>

<p>“What you mean or mean not, I know not!” said
Joan. “But I am all but a stranger to you, sir, and
I will to remain so! Will you not go?—and my
father shall bring you the writings—”</p>

<p>Carthew’s hand clasped and unclasped. He had
gone further than he ever meant to go to-day.
Indeed, he had no plan, no gathered ideas. He might
have pleaded that he was himself a victim, struck
down unawares. Forces within had gathered, no
doubt, for a violent reaction after violent, long-continued
repression, and chance had set a woman,
young and fair, in the eye of the reaction—and
now in his soul there was a divided will and war,
war! His brow showed struggle and misery, even
while his eyes and parted lips desired wholly.</p>

<p>With effort he won a temporary control. “I did
not mean to frighten you. I mean no harm. I will
say nothing more—not now, at least. Yes, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
ride away now, and come for the writing another
day.—See, I am naught now but friend and well-wisher!”</p>

<p>That a squire’s brother should conceive that he
might take some slight liberty with a cotter’s daughter,
that he might, on a May day and none looking,
snatch a kiss or steal an arm about her, was truly,
in Joan’s time, neither a great rarity nor a great
matter. If it went no further than that, it need
not be especially remembered. Rebuff with vigour,
if you chose, but so that the thing ended there, it
was no hanging matter! At the castle, page or esquire
might have been more forward than Carthew,
and Joan, though she sent them about their business,
might have done so with some inward laughter.
But Master Harry Carthew! He was a Puritan,
strict and stern, he was always with the minister,
he walked with the Bible and by the Bible. He was
no hypocrite either; it was easy to see that he was
earnest. Then what did he have to do with coming
here so, troubling her so? Joan felt a surge of
anger and fright. Something boding and pestilential
seemed to gather like a mist about her.</p>

<p>The two, both silent now, moved out of the
shadow of the fruit trees into the blossomy handbreadth
before the cottage door. As they did so,
Alison Inch came by the gate, saw the horse fastened
to the elm, and, looking through the wicket,
Carthew and Joan. If she had meant to come in
or no did not appear; she stood stock-still for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
moment, then put herself into motion again and
passed on.</p>

<p>If Carthew saw her, he paid no attention. But
Joan saw her, saw her face quite plainly. When Carthew—with
a sudden and harsh “Good-bye for
this time; or, good-bye forever, if so be I can yet
kill this thing within me!”—strode away and
through the gate, and, mounting his horse, rode off
with a stiff bearing, not looking back, she stood for a
moment or two with a still, expressionless face, then,
moving slowly to the doorstep, sat down and took
her head into her hands. She was seeing again Alison’s
face. “That’s what she meant the other day—she
meant that at church I was minding, not the
psalm, but that man.... Then, doth she mind him
so herself that she looked so, there at the gate?...
Woe’s me!” mourned Joan. “Here’s a coil!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE OAK GRANGE</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap"><span class="smcap">Aderhold</span></span> sat in the moth-eaten old chair, in the
bare room, beside the bed in which, seventy-odd
years before, Master Hardwick had been born and
in which he was now to die. The old man lay high
upon the pillows. He slept a good deal, but when he
waked his mind was clear, not weakened like his
body. Indeed, the physician thought that the mental
flame burned more strongly toward the end, as
though Death fanned away some heavy and dulling
vapour.</p>

<p>Master Hardwick was sleeping now. Old Dorothy
had tiptoed in to see how matters went, and, after
a whispered word, had tiptoed out again. She was
fond of Aderhold—she said that the Oak Grange
had been human since he came.</p>

<p>He sat musing in the great chair. Four years....
Four years in this still house. He felt a great
pity for the old man lying drawn and crumpled there
beside him, a pity and affection. The two were
kindred. He had this refuge, this nook in the world,
this home to be grateful for, and he was grateful.
Moreover, the old man depended upon him, depended
and clung.... Four years—four years
of security and peace. They had been bought at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
price. He saw himself, a silent figure, watching all
things but saying naught, keeping silence, conforming,
agreeing by his silence. He thought a braver
man would not have been so silent.... Four
years—four years of the quietest routine, going
where there was sickness and he was called, wandering
far afield in a country not thickly peopled, lying
musing by streams or in deep woods, or moving upon
long bare hilltops with the storm sky or the blue
sky, going punctually to church each Sunday, paying
to the tithing-man some part of his scant earnings
... then at the Oak Grange sitting with this
old man, drawing him, when he could, out of his
self-absorption and his fears. Aderhold was tender
with his fears; that which weighed upon his own
soul was his own fear, and it made him comprehend
the other’s terrors, idle though he thought they
were. He thought that from some other dimension
his own would seem as idle—and yet they bowed
him down, and kept him forever fabricating a mask.</p>

<p>Four years. In the small bare room which was
called his and which, through care for old Dorothy,
he himself kept and cleaned, there stood an oaken
press, where under lock and key he guarded ink
and pen and paper and a book that he was writing.
That guess at qualities, at origins and destinies, that
more or less mystical vision, taste and apprehension
of ground and consequence, that intuition of all
things in flood, of form out of form, of unity in
motion—all that in France he had outspoken, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in speaking had like to have lost liberty and life—all
that he had not spoken of here these four years,
hard-by Hawthorn Village and church—all this he
was striving to put there upon paper. He rose at
dawn and wrote while the light strengthened; he
bought himself candles and wrote at night when all
the place was so still that silence grew sound. Four
years—.</p>

<p>Master Hardwick stirred, opened his eyes. “Gilbert!”</p>

<p>“I am here, cousin.”</p>

<p>“How long—?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. You do not fail fast nor easily.
Your body is courageous.”</p>

<p>He gave him to drink. As he put down the cup
Dorothy opened the door. Behind her appeared a
man with a black dress, close-cut hair, and a steeple-crowned
hat. Although the day was warm he had
about him a wide cloak. He was short and thin,
with a pale, acrimonious, zealot’s face. He carried
in his hand a Geneva Bible.</p>

<p>Dorothy stammered out, “Master Clement did
not wish to wait, master—”</p>

<p>Clement spoke for himself. “While I waited your
master’s soul might have perished, for a soul can
perish in a twinkling.” He put the old woman aside
with his hand and came forward from the door to
the bed. “How do you do to-day, Master Hardwick?”</p>

<p>The old man made a feeble movement upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
pillows. “I do as I have done, Master Clement,—I
run rapidly toward this life’s end.”</p>

<p>“Yea,” said the minister, “and I fear me that you
run toward worse than this life’s end! I am come—I
am come, Master Hardwick, to wrestle with the
Devil for thy soul! I tell thee, it stands in mortal
danger of dropping from life’s end into that gulf
where Dives burns and is mocked from Abraham’s
bosom!”</p>

<p>Aderhold had risen. Dorothy, having placed a
chair for Master Clement, was on the point of vanishing,
but the minister called her back. “Stay,
woman, and be edified likewise! Or wait! Call also
the serving-man and the lad that I saw without. It
befits that a dying man, suing for pardon to an
offended King, should have his household about
him.”</p>

<p>Dorothy brought them in, Will and the boy, her
nephew. The three stood in a solemn row. Long
habit had made them accept old master and his
ways, but they did not doubt that he stood in peril
of his soul. It was proper that the minister should
exhort him. They stood with slightly lifted and
exalted countenances. After all, so little came into
their lives to make them feel a comparative righteousness,
to set them in any wise upon a platform
of honour!</p>

<p>Master Hardwick lay awake and conscious but
passed beyond much speaking. Aderhold withdrew
into the shadow of the bed-curtains, and out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
this twilight regarded Master Clement. He knew
of more than one or two heroic things which this man
had done. Moreover, he had heard that years before,
when Calvin had by no means as yet tinctured
England, Master Clement had stoutly set up his
standard and kept strict vigil before it. It was whispered
that he had stood in the pillory for “No Pope—and
No Prelates!” Aderhold, gazing upon him,
was aware that Master Clement would endure persecution
as unflinchingly as, indubitably, he would
inflict it. Each quality somehow cancelled the other—Master
Clement was out of it—and there was
left only the gross waste and suffering....</p>

<p>Aderhold had heard priest and preacher, after
pulpit cries of human worthlessness, of the insignificance
of the soul, of universal and hopeless guilt, of
the inflamed mind of God, of the hell which, in the
course of nature, awaited every child of Adam, of
the predestination of some, indeed, through grace
of another, to an unearned glory, of the eternal,
insufferable loss and anguish of those multitudes
and multitudes and multitudes, who either had
never known or heard of that remedy, or who, the
Devil at their ear, had made bold to doubt its utter
efficacy—he had heard and seen such men, at
death-beds, in the presence of solemn and temperate
Death, turn from what they preached to Reason
and Love. He had heard them try to smooth away
the deep and dark trenches in the bewildered brain
which they themselves had done their best to dig.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
He thought their conversion the saddest miracle—sad,
for it did not last. Death passed for that
time from their view, back they went to preach to
listening throngs who must die, Inherited Guilt, Inherited,
fiendish punishment, an Inherited, fearful
God, an Inherited curse upon enquiry, and the humbling,
indeed, of an Inherited vicarious atonement....
He wondered that they never foresaw their
own death-bed. He thought that they never truly,
bone and marrow, believed what they said, but that
the reverberating voices of the ages behind them
stunned, went through them, produced an automatic
voice and action. To resist that insistence, to breast
the roaring stream of the past—he acknowledged
that it was difficult, difficult!</p>

<p>Three or four times in these years he had chanced
to find himself together with Master Clement at
some death-bed. Once he had seen him soften—a
child dying and crying out in terror of the Judgement
Day. “You were baptized—you were baptized—”
repeated the minister to him over and over again.
“I baptized you myself. You are safe—you are
safe, my dear child! The Lord Christ will help you—the
Lord Christ will help you—” But the child
had died in terror.</p>

<p>To-day there was no softening in the aspect of
Master Clement. This old man before him was a
wretched miser hoarding gold, a solitary who in this
dark old house as probably as not practised alchemy,
lusting to turn lead and iron into gold, and as probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
as not practised it by unlawful and demoniacal
aid. Rarely was he seen in church—too feeble to
come, he said; too unwilling, thought Master Clement.
He did not give of his substance, he was bitter
and misliked, he asked no prayers—Master Clement
had many counts against him, and was fain
to believe that they tallied with God’s counts. He
girded himself and came forth to wrestle with and
throw this soul, and by the hair of its head to drag
it from the edge of the bottomless pit. He wrestled
for the better part of an hour.</p>

<p>Master Hardwick lay unwinking, high upon his
pillows. Aderhold could not tell how much really
entered ear and mind; the old man seemed to be
regarding something far away, something growing
in the distance. The pity of it, he thought, was for
Will and old Dorothy and the boy; they were drinking,
drinking.</p>

<p>At last Master Clement desisted. He stared with
a fixed face at Master Hardwick who stared beyond
him. “Thou impenitent old man—!” He
rose and with a gesture dismissed the three in line.
Will and Dorothy and the boy filed out, primed
to discuss among themselves master’s impenitency.
“I go now, Master Hardwick,” said the minister,
“but I shall come again to-morrow, though I fear me
thou art as utterly lost as any man in England!”</p>

<p>Aderhold accompanied him from the chamber
into the hall. He knew that it was in order to speak
with unction of the just closed exhortation; to wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
at the minister’s fervent power, and deprecate
with sighs and shaken head the horrible wickedness
of the human heart; to marvel that any could hold
out against the truth so presented—how many
times had he heard such an utterance and seen the
self-congratulation behind—how many times! He
knew that the pause which the minister made, unconscious
as it certainly was, was a pause for the
accustomed admiration. When it did not come he
saw that, as unconsciously again, Master Clement’s
mistrust of him deepened. He knew that, for all
his locked lips and eyes withheld from expression,
for all his stillness, repression, and church-going,
the minister liked him not. The clash of minds
came subtly through whatever walls you might
build around it.</p>

<p>“I fear, Master Aderhold,” now said the minister,
“that you have done little during your residence
with your kinsman to bring him to repentance.
Surely, in these years of such close communion, a
godly man could have done much! Such a man as
Harry Carthew would have had him by now day
and night upon his knees!”</p>

<p>Aderhold sighed, then dropped the veil, and raising
his head, spoke eye to eye. “I would that I could
make you believe, Master Clement, that there is in
this old man who is coming to die more good than
ill. In these years that you speak of, I have seen
that good grow, of its own motion, upon the ill.
Why may it not continue, throughout oceans yet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
experience, to suffuse and gain upon and dissolve
and reconcile unto itself the ill?”</p>

<p>Master Clement drew a sharp “Ha!” of triumph.
Here was heterodoxy raising its head, and the man
had always looked to him heterodox! “Ha! ‘<i>Of its
own motion!</i>’ Beware—beware, Master Aderhold!
I have marked you—I am marking you still! Beware
lest one day you be cited for a creeping, insidious
doubter and insinuator of false doctrine!”</p>

<p>He went away, striding by the fairy oak in his
wide cloak and steeple hat, with a pale, wrathful,
intense face. Aderhold returned to the room and his
patient. Master Hardwick lay upon his pillows,
with a countenance much as it had been. Aderhold,
saying nothing, sat beside him, and presently he fell
asleep. Outside it was high summer, but cool, with
a moving air and a rustling of every leaf. Hours
passed, the day waned, the dusk set in. Aderhold,
moving softly, made a fire in the cavernous fireplace,
where, even in winter, Master Hardwick
rarely wasted firewood.</p>

<p>When he came back the old man was awake.</p>

<p>“Gilbert!”</p>

<p>“Yes, cousin.”</p>

<p>“I have a feeling that I am going to-night—”</p>

<p>“It is possible.”</p>

<p>“Gilbert ... you’ve been comfortable to me
these four years. You’ve been a kind of warmth
and stay, asking nothing, not wasting or spending,
but giving.... They think I am rich, but I am not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
I was never very rich.... I ventured in the Indies’
voyage and gained, and then I was a fool and ventured
again and lost. Since then I have been a poor
man. It is the truth.... Give me something to keep
me up—”</p>

<p>Aderhold gave him wine. After a moment he
spoke again. “There are creditors in the town
that you’ll hear from. They’ll take the land—all
but the bit about the house. That and the house
I’ve willed you—kin to me, and kind as well....
The gold they say I’ve buried—I’ve buried none.
There are twenty pieces that you’ll find in an opening
of the wall behind the panel there—” He
pointed with a shaking hand that sank at once.
“It’s all that’s left—and you’ll have to bury me
from it.... A miser.... Maybe, but what I saved
only lasted me through with spare living. If I had
told them of that heavy loss—my gold gone down
at sea, and that, even so, it was not so much I had
had to venture ... would they have believed me?
No! I was a miser—I lied and hid my gold....
Well, I did not tell them.... Do not tell all that
you know and empty yourself like a wine skin—”
His voice sank, he slept again.</p>

<p>Aderhold thought that he might sink from sleep
into stupor and so die painlessly and without words.
But in the middle of the night he waked again.</p>

<p>“Gilbert!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am here.”</p>

<p>“What did you think of all that which Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Clement had to say?... How much was true and
how much was false?”</p>

<p>“There was some truth. But much of it was false.
It is false because reason and feeling, the mind and
the spirit recoil from it. Whatever is, that is not.”</p>

<p>“I never thought it was.... I’ve been called sour
and hard and withholding, and maybe I am it all.
But I would not make an imperfect creature and
then plague it through eternity for its imperfection....
Gilbert—”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“What would you do?”</p>

<p>Aderhold came and knelt beside the bed, and laid
his hands over the cold and shrunken hand of Master
Hardwick. “I would trust and hope—and that
not less in myself than in that Other that seems to
spread around us. I think that ourselves and that
Other may turn out to be the same. I would think of
myself as continuing, as journeying on, as surely
carrying with me, in some fashion, memory of the
past, as growing endlessly through endless experience.
I would take courage. And if, in my heart, I
knew that in this life I had at times—not all the
time, but at times—been sour and hard and withholding
and fearful, and if I felt in my heart that
that made against light and love and wisdom and
strength for all—then, as I lay here dying, and as
I died, I would put that withholding and fear from
me, and step forth toward better things.... There
is within you a fountain of love and strength.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Trust yourself to your higher self.... Hoist sail
and away!”</p>

<p>The night passed, and at dawn Master Hardwick
died. Aderhold closed his eyes, straightened his
limbs, and smoothed the bed upon which he lay.
Going to the window he set the casement wide. The
dawn was coming up in stairs and slopes of splendour.
The divine freshness, the purity, the high, austere
instigation, the beginning again.... The dawn perpetual,
never ceasing, the dawn elsewhere when here
would be noon, the dawn elsewhere when here would
be night—Never, from the first mists upon earth
rising to the great sun, had dawn failed, dawn rising
from the bath of night and sleep, dawn the new birth,
the beginning again, the clean-washed.... Aderhold
breathed the divine air, the blended solemnity
and sweetness. The light was growing, a thousand
beauties were unfolding, and with them laughter and
song. The water rippling over the stones came to
him with a sound of merriment. The window was
clustered around with ivy and a spray nodded,
nodded against his hand with an effect of familiarity,
a friend tapping to call his attention. From some
near-by bush a thrush began to sing—so golden,
so clear. “O moving great and small!” said Aderhold;
“O thought of all sense and soul, gathered,
interfused, and aware of a magic Oneness! O macrocosm
that I, the microcosm, will one day lift to
and be and know that I am—O sea of all faiths,
O temperer of every concept, O eternal permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and tolerance, nurse of growth and artifex of form
from form!... These children’s masks which we lift
upon a stick and call Thee, crying, Lo, this is God
with the fixed face—”</p>

<p>He rested a little longer in the window, listening
to the thrush, then turned, looked again at the quiet
figure upon the bed, and going from the room
wakened old Dorothy and the boy. Later that day,
Will, Goodman Cole, old Heron, and a lawyer from
the town being present, he searched for and found the
spring that opened the panel Master Hardwick had
indicated. Behind was a recess, and within it twenty
gold-pieces. He gave them into the lawyer’s hands
for keeping.</p>

<p>They buried Master Hardwick in Hawthorn
Churchyard. Hard upon the end of that, there appeared
a merchant and a man of means from the
town with a note-of-hand. The farm land, such as
it was, would go there in satisfaction. The lawyer
produced a will made one year before. Lacking issue
and near kindred, Master Hardwick left all that he
had, his creditors being satisfied, to his loving cousin,
the physician, Gilbert Aderhold. What that was in
reality was solely the decaying old house and the
few acres of worn garden and orchard immediately
surrounding it. The twenty pieces of gold, when all
was paid, shrunk to three.</p>

<p>Aderhold dwelled solitary in the Oak Grange as
he and his kinsman had dwelled solitary before. The
land around went no longer with the Grange, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
there was no change else. The old tenants hung on;
it still spread, poor in soil, poorly tilled, shut off from
the richer vale by Hawthorn Forest. Will no longer
came to the Grange; Aderhold, old Dorothy, and
the boy lived in the place and kept it. There was no
other money than the scant sixpences and shillings
that the physician gained. To sell the house sounded
well, but there was no purchaser. The place was
ruinous, lonely, and without advantage, said to be
haunted as well. Aderhold, only, had grown to
love it, the ivied walls and the wild garden, the oak
and the stream, and the room where he took from
behind locked doors his book and sat and wrote.
All was so quiet, still, secure, there behind the shield
of Hawthorn Forest....</p>

<p>But Hawthorn countryside and village refused to
believe that the gold was gone. It was known that
the dead miser had had a chest-full of broad pieces.
Probably he had buried this great store—some
said under the house itself, some said under the
fairies’ oak. Wherever it was buried, certainly the
leech must know where it was; or if he did not know
yet, he would. If one were to go that way through
Hawthorn Forest, and come into sight of the house
and see a candle passing from window to window,
or hear a digging sound in the orchard or beneath
the ill-named oak, that would be he.... A whisper
arose, none knew how, that Master Hardwick had
practised alchemy, and that his kinsman practised
it too; that he knew how to make gold. If he knew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
then, of course, he would be making it, in the dead of
night. Could you make gold alone, unaided by any
but your own powers? Alchemists, it was known,
did not hesitate to raise a spirit or demon. Then
there was little difference between an alchemist and
a sorcerer?... There came among the whispers a
counter-statement from several cotters and poor
folk. Master Aderhold was no sorcerer—he was
a good leech; witness such and such a cure! Whereupon
opposition sharpened the whisperers’ ingenuity.
Aye, perhaps the demon helped him cure as
well as make gold! Came another counter—he was
a good church-goer. So! <i>but Master Clement thinks
not highly of him</i>.</p>

<p>How this vortex and whirling storm began, whose
breath first stirred it up, it were hard to say. It had
moved in widening rings for months, before Aderhold
discovered how darkened was the air about
him.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">IN HAWTHORN FOREST</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was winter—a mild, bright, winter’s day—when,
for the second time, he met and spoke to Joan in the
forest. She was standing beneath a beech tree, in
her hand a dry, fallen bough which she was brandishing
and making play with as though it had been
a quarter-staff. She was singing, though not in the
least loudly,—</p>

<p class="pp6sq p1">“‘I have heard talk of bold Robin Hood,</p>
<p class="pp7">And of brave Little John,</p>
<p class="pp6">Of Friar Tuck and Will Scarlet,</p>
<p class="pp7">Locksley and Maid Marian—’”</p>

<p class="p1">When she saw Aderhold close to her she started
violently.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” he said. “I meant not to frighten
you!”</p>

<p>She looked at him curiously and shook her head.
“No.... You did not frighten me. I am not at all
frighted.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “You say that as though you were
surprised at yourself.”</p>

<p>She looked at him again with grey eyes half-troubled,
half-fearless. “It isn’t so hard to surprise
yourself.... You did take that cat you gave me from
the boys who were stoning her at the burned cot?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Aderhold, surprised in his turn.
“Why?”</p>

<p>She stammered. “I heard them talking, and
though I believe not such things, I—I—”</p>

<p>“What things?”</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, then faced him with
courage. “I have heard talk that you don’t believe
what other people believe, that you deny things that
are in the Bible, and that maybe you practise sorcery
there in the Oak Grange.... And—and some
one once told me that—that people like that had
always familiars which went mostly like little animals
such as a cat or small dog, or sometimes a bird
or a frog,—and that—and that if they offered to
give you such a thing for a gift and—and you took
it, you signed yourself so to the Evil One.... But—but
I do not believe such things. They are
against all goodness and—and good sense.”</p>

<p>She ended somewhat breathlessly; for all her courage,
which was great, her heart was beating hard.</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Aderhold. “Such things
are against all goodness and good sense—and they
do not happen.... I was going to see a sick man,
and passing by the burned cottage, I heard the cat
crying, and went and took her from the boys. She’s
naught but just your fireside cat. And I am a solitary
man who has no familiar and knows no magic.”</p>

<p>He drew a heavy, oppressed breath. “I did not
know that there was any such talk.... It is miserable
that there should be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood leaning against a tree, with half-shut
eyes. Old fears came over him in a thick and sickening
wave.</p>

<p>“Oh—talk!” said Joan. “There’s always such
a weary deal of talk.” She had regained her calm;
at least she was no longer afraid of the physician.
But for all that—and for all her comparative happiness
this beautiful day and for her singing—she
looked older and less care-free than she had done
last year. Her face was thinner, and there appeared
in her, now and again, a startled, listening
air. It came now. “Do you hear a horse coming?”</p>

<p>At no part in the forest were you far from some
cart track along which might, indeed, push a horseman.
One was here now, leaving the track and coming
between the tree boles. Presumably he had
heard voices.</p>

<p>Joan rose to her feet. Her eyes were glittering.
“No peace—” she said. “He leaves me no peace
at all. I wish he were dead.”</p>

<p>She spoke in a very low voice, hardly above a
whisper, measured, but tinctured with both anger
and dread. It was Harry Carthew, Aderhold now
saw, who approached. He caught sight of them,
checked the roan a perceptible moment, then came
on. The great horse stopped within ten feet of the
two beneath the beech tree. Carthew sat looking at
them, a strange expression upon his face.</p>

<p>Aderhold had no knowledge of the why or wherefore
of his look, though Joan’s ejaculation might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
making for illumination. But his mind was preoccupied
with those pale fears which her earlier speech
had awakened. He was thinking only of these—or
rather he was not consciously thinking at all; he was
only gathering his forces forward after the recoil.
He answered Carthew’s look with a somewhat blank
gaze. “Good-day,” he said.</p>

<p>“Give you good-day,” answered Carthew. “How
long have you and Joan Heron been trysting?”</p>

<p>Aderhold’s thoughts were still away. He repeated
the word after the other, but put no meaning to it.
“‘Trysting’—”</p>

<p>It was Joan who took it up, with a flame of anger.
“Who is trysting, Master Carthew?—Not one of
these three—not he with me, nor I with him, nor I
with you! God’s mercy! Cannot a girl speak a civil
word to a chance-met neighbour—”</p>

<p>“‘Neighbour,’” said Carthew. “That is true. I
had not thought of that. The Grange and Heron’s
cottage are not so far apart—might be said to be
neighbours.—’Neighbours’—it is easy for neighbours
to meet—with this dark wood touching each
house.” He lifted his hand to his throat, then
turned upon Aderhold with a brow so black, a gesture
so violent that the other instinctively gave back
a pace. “I have been blind!” cried Carthew thickly.
“I have been blind!”</p>

<p>Aderhold, amazed, spoke with an awakening and
answering anger. “I do not know what you mean,
Master Carthew,—or, if I guess, seeing that your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
words will bear that interpretation,—I will tell you
that your bolt goes wide!—Mistress Joan Heron
and I chanced to meet five minutes before you appeared
before us—and I do think in my soul that
it is the second time we have spoken together in our
lives! And I know not your right—”</p>

<p>“‘Right!’” broke in Joan with passion. “He has
no right! And I will not have him couple my name
here and couple it there! Oh, I would”—her eyes
blazed at Carthew—“I would that so great a saint
would leave this earth and go to heaven—if that,
indeed, is where you belong!”</p>

<p>Carthew sat his horse, dark as a thunder-cloud,
and for all his iron frame and power of control, shaking
like a leaf. “I believe neither of you,” he said
thickly. He looked at Joan. “This is why you will
not turn to me.”</p>

<p>Her eyes flamed against him. “I never thought to
hate a human creature as you have made me hate
you!—And now I am going home.”</p>

<p>She snatched up the staff with which she had been
playing and turned with decision. He turned his
horse also, but uncertainly, with his eyes yet upon
Aderhold. Black wrath and jealousy were written
in his face, and something else, a despairing struggle
against total self-abandonment. “Stay a moment!”
he cried to Joan. “Will you swear by God on high
that you and this man have not been meeting, meeting
in Hawthorn Forest?”</p>

<p>Joan turned, stood still the moment asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Master Carthew, shall I tell you what I shall
shortly do if you leave me not alone? I shall go with
my father to the squire your brother, and to the
minister, and to the three most zealous men in
Hawthorn Parish, and I shall say to them, ‘This
holy and zealous young man whom I have heard you,
Master Clement, call Joseph, and young David, and
what-not—this same Master Harry Carthew, who
will speak and exhort and pray with sinners,—this
same man has for months made a harmless girl’s life
wretched to her, offering loathed love and insult—’”</p>

<p>Her voice broke; she threw up her arms in a gesture
of anger and unhappiness and fled away. Carthew
sat like a graven image, watching her go. He
spoke to himself, in a curious voice from the lips
only. “If ever I should come to hate you as now I—”
and again—“She will never dare—” The last
flutter of her skirt vanished among the trees. Suddenly
he said with violence, “She denied it not!”
and turned upon Aderhold as though he would ride
him down.</p>

<p>The physician caught the bridle of the roan.
“You are mad, Master Carthew! Look at me!”</p>

<p>He forced the other’s gaze upon him and a somewhat
cooler judgement into his eyes. Each, with his
inner vision, was viewing in waves and sequences
past relations, knowledge, and impressions. For the
first time, general observation and lukewarm interest
quickened into the keen and particular and well-warmed.
Aderhold saw again Carthew at the Rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Tavern, and Carthew upon the road; heard again
Carthew’s cosmic speculations and Carthew’s expressed
sense of sin. Four years gone by, and yet
that impression remained the most deeply graved.
After that came the long stretch of time in this region,
and, during it, little speech, few meetings with
Carthew. There had been knowledge that at times
he was away, often for months, from Hawthorn,
and there had been observation at church and elsewhere
of the sterner sort in him of Puritan zeal and
faith, together with hearsay that the minister and
he were like elder and younger brother in the word,
and the younger a growing power in this part of
England and a chosen vessel. And there had been
a kind of half-melancholy, half-artistic and philosophic
recognition of the perfection of the specimen
Carthew afforded. In look, frame, dress, countenance,
temper, and inward being, he seemed the
exactest symbol!—Nowhere further than all this
had Aderhold come until to-day.</p>

<p>As for Carthew, with far narrower powers of reflection,
and with those concentrated with hectic
intensity in a small round, it might be said that in
these years he had barely regarded or thought of the
physician at all. Such a statement would be true of
all sides but one. Master Clement had, within the
past year, doubted to him any true zeal in religion
on the part of the physician, and had set up a faint
current of observation and misliking. It had been
nothing much; at times, when he thought of it, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
marked Aderhold at church, how he looked and demeaned
himself; once or twice when he had overheard
some peasant speak of the leech, he had come in with
his deep and stern voice. “Aye? Can he doctor thy
soul as well as thy body?” But the whole together
had weighed little. He had the soul of Harry Carthew
to be concerned for ... though, of course, for
that very soul’s salvation, it behooved to see that
other lamps were kept burning.... Nay, it behooved
for those others’ salvation—for the warfare of the
true saint was for the salvation of every soul alive!—All
this was before the past few months. Through
these months he had thought but of one thing—or
if at all of another thing, then of how his own soul
was on the brink of the pit, with the Devil whispering,
and the heat of the flame of hell already burning
within him.... And now, suddenly, it seemed
that the physician living at the Oak Grange was a
figure in the sum. He looked at him, and where
before he had seen but a silently coming and going
learned man, to be somewhat closely watched by
God’s saints lest mysterious knowledge should lead
him astray, he saw now a tall man, still young, not
ill-looking, with strange knowledge that might teach
him how to ingratiate.... He spoke in a hollow
voice. “I have been blind.”</p>

<p>“Whatever you may have been,” said Aderhold
with impatience, “you are blind in this hour. Look
at me! Not for the sake of myself, but for the sake of
truth, and to guard another from misapprehension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and to take a strange poison from your mind, I
swear most solemnly that that maid and I were
chance-met but now beneath this tree; that we
spoke most generally, and far afield from what you
madly imagine; and that, save for once before as
chance and momentary a meeting, never have we
been alone together! I swear that I think in that
wise of no woman, and no woman of me!”</p>

<p>“I would,” said Carthew heavily, “that I knew
that you speak truth.”</p>

<p>“I speak it,” said Aderhold. “And in turn I
would that you might bring wisdom and better love
into your counsel, and leave the maid alone!”</p>

<p>Carthew looked at him. “Is there idle talk. Have
you heard such tongue-clatter?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” answered the other. “What I perceive
you yourself have shown.”</p>

<p>“Or she has said,” said Carthew. He moistened
his lips. “Foolish maids will make much of slight
matters!—If I have slipped a little—if Satan hath
tempted me and the foul weakness of universal
nature—so that I have chanced, perhaps, to give
her a kiss or to tell her that she was fair—what hath
it been to her hurt? Naught—no hurt at all. But
to me.... Nay, I will recover myself. God help
me! I will not put my soul in perdition. God help
me!” He lifted his clasped hands, then let them
drop to his saddle-bow. “I will begin by believing
even where I believe not! What hurt to me if now
and again you and Joan Heron speak in passing?—so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
be it that with your evil learning and your
commerce who knows where, you put not the maid’s
soul in peril ... so be it that you touch not her lips
nor her hand—” He ceased to speak, his face working.</p>

<p>“You are much to be pitied,” said Aderhold.
“Have you finished?—for I would be going.”</p>

<p>He drew his cloak about him, and made to pass
the other.</p>

<p>Carthew did not detain him; he only said, “But I
shall watch you,” gathered up the roan’s reins, and
himself rode starkly off in the direction of the village.</p>

<p>Back upon the forest track which he had pursued,
and then upon the road that ran between Hawthorn
and the Oak Grange, he saw naught of Joan, though
he looked for her. She was fleet-footed; by now she
was within her own door. But on the road, no great
distance beyond the cottage, he came upon another
woman, walking toward the village. This was the
sempstress’s daughter, Alison Inch.... Two years
gone by, Alison had spent some weeks in Carthew
House, sewing for Madam Carthew. He had been
reading aloud that winter to his sister-in-law, who
was a learned and pious lady, and Alison had sat
in a corner, sewing and listening. The reading
done, he had at times explained the discourse or
added illustration, encouraging the women to ask
questions.—He felt friendly toward Alison, and
always, since that time, answered her curtsy when
they chanced to meet by a grave enquiry as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
her health and welfare, the spiritual being meant
rather than the bodily. To-day he walked his horse
beside her.</p>

<p>“You have been riding through the forest, sir?”
she asked. “It is a fine day for riding.”</p>

<p>“Yes—I wished to enquire for a man at the
North-End Farm.”</p>

<p>He rode and she walked in silence, then she spoke
in a dry, thin, and strained voice. “I was walking to
Heron’s cottage to see Joan. But she was not there.—She’s
not much like others. When she gets her
work done, she’s off to herself somewhere—maybe
to the wood, maybe elsewhere. It’s often so that
you can’t find her.”</p>

<p>Now Carthew had found, too, that you couldn’t
always find her. Suddenly his brow grew black
again; he had not put that two and two together.
“Alison,” he said and paused.</p>

<p>Alison, with an air of not looking at him at all,
was watching closely. “Yes, Master Carthew?”</p>

<p>He rode a little farther in silence, then he said
determinedly: “Master Aderhold who lives at the
Oak Grange—” He paused.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” said Alison.</p>

<p>“He is a strange man,” said Carthew. “I remember
when he came to Hawthorn, when I rode with
him from the town, I thought him of a strange and
doubtful mind.—We have not caught him tripping
yet, but Master Clement holds that he thinks perversely,
not according to sound doctrine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“People say that he makes gold and hoards it,”
said Alison, “and that he hath a familiar.” She was
not interested in Master Aderhold, but she would
keep up whatever ball Master Harry Carthew tossed.</p>

<p>“I know not as to that,” said Carthew. “It is
enough if he setteth up his own judgement and
denieth essential doctrines.—It were surely ill for
any upon whom he might thrust his company—ill,
I mean, for them to be seen with him often and in
close talk. In common charity any such should be
warned. I dare aver he is often straying through the
forest or upon this road.”</p>

<p>Alison looked aside. She did not know yet what he
would be at, but her every sense was sharpened.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen,” asked Carthew with careful
carelessness—“have you ever chanced to see him
and Goodman Heron’s daughter Joan together?”</p>

<p>Alison walked thrice her own length upon the
shadowy road before she answered. It took a little
time to get it straight. It wasn’t Joan’s soul that he
was concerned about—thought one. He was putting
her name with that of the leech—had he seen
them together, and now was eaten with jealousy?
She knew how it felt to be eaten with jealousy—thought
two. If he believed that Joan played him
false—put him off for another—it could not but
help, his thinking that....</p>

<p>“Oh, aye!” said Alison. “I have seen them a dozen
times walking and talking together in the forest.
But what a sin, sir, if he should teach her heresy!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PLAGUE</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Late</span> that winter, after long immunity, black sickness
came to the town with the great church and the
castle, and cast a long, crooked finger across the
river and in the direction of Hawthorn Village. In
the streets of the town burned fires of juniper. Waking
in the night you might hear the wheels of the
death-cart. They stopped before this house, they
stopped before that house. The thought trembled
and shrank—one night will they stop before this
house? In the daytime the bells were tolled.</p>

<p>Hawthorn Village tolled no bells, for to toll bells
savoured of “superstitious usages.” But it looked
with a clammy terror at the black finger which had
touched a farmhouse midway between village and
town.</p>

<p>The plague grew worse in the town. More and yet
more houses were marked and shut. The richer sort
and those who could left the place, scattered through
the country, not always welcome where they appeared.
The mass who must stay saw the horror
increase. A pall came over the place; there grew an
insistent and rapid murmur of prayers. Side by side
with that occurred a relaxation and neglect of usual
order. The strict rule in such cases was against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
people coming together in any manner of congregation
whereby the infection might spread; but the
watch grew sick and fear constantly sought companions.
There was much drinking in alehouses and
taverns, no little gathering together of one sort and
another. Side by side with wild appeals and supplications
to Heaven wavered a sick and wan determination
to some sort of mirth. At times this spirit
rose to dare-deviltry. Small crimes increased. The
poor were the hardest stricken, seeing that for them
starvation clanked behind disease. Theft and housebreaking
grew common, while professional thieves
might and did make a harvest feast. The church bells
tolled. At night the death-carts increased in number,
the closed houses increased in number, the juniper
smoke rolled thicker and thicker.</p>

<p>But after one death in the farmhouse, halfway to
Hawthorn, the black finger drew back. No one else
at the farm was taken, the scattered houses between
it and the village went unscathed; time passed and
no harm came to Hawthorn. Some said the river
barred the infection, others that the air was different.
One or two at most called attention to the great
crowding in the town, to the massed poverty and
dirt,—whereas the village was open-built and reasonably
clean,—and to the traffic between the
town and a large seaport, whereas small was the
business of Hawthorn and few the strangers. But
the most part of Hawthorn Village and the country
to the north of it knew otherwise and said otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with unction and lifted looks. Pestilence came like
comets, as a visitation and a sign from on high.
Jehovah launched the one and the other. Fire
against the cities of the plain—plague against prelatical
towns and castles, only not Popish by a narrow
line, retainers of stained glass and images, organ-players
and bowers of the head, waiting but their
chance to reinstate a wearing of copes and lighting
of candles! The wonder was not that the plague
came, but that Jehovah had so long withheld his
hand! In Hawthorn Church they prayed that the
plague might cease from the afflicted town, but
prayed knowing that the plague had been deserved.
Now that the outstretched black finger had been definitely
withdrawn, the analyst might have found
in the prayer of some—not of all—a flavour of triumph.
Was it not also Jehovah’s doing that the pure
faith was so adorned with health and vindicated?</p>

<p>The town grew a gloomy place indeed, filled with
apprehension. People viewing it from distant hills
professed to see hanging over it a darkened and
quivering air of its own. The streets had a deserted
look, with fires burning and none around them. The
death-carts went more frequently, and the bells
clanged, clanged. There was a need of physicians,
those in the place being overworked and one smitten.
About the time that the black finger drew back from
the farmhouse, Gilbert Aderhold walked to the town
and offered his services. Thereafter for weeks he was
busied, day and night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Up in the castle above the town, a kinsman of the
earl’s stayed on after the hurried departure of the
great family to another seat in an untouched countryside.
Heir to a burdened estate and courtier out
of favour, not pleased for reasons of his own to
remove with the earl, and liking for another set of
reasons the very solitariness of the huge old abode,
assured that the infection would not mount the cliff
and pass the castle wood, and constitutionally careless
of danger, he asked leave to stay on, keep ward
with the old housekeeper, the armour in the hall, the
earl’s regiment of books, and his own correspondence
with foreign scholars. He stayed, and for
exercise rode through the country roundabout, and
now and then, to satisfy a philosophic curiosity,
through the town itself. The ideas of the time as to
quarantine were lax enough. The sick were shut
away in the houses, purifying fires burned in the
streets; if you were careful to avoid any who looked
in the faintest degree as though they might be sickening,
life and business might go on. The rider from
the castle, when he came down into the place, carried
with him and put often to his nostrils a quantity
of medicated spices and perfumed grains from the
Orient, carried in a small perforated silver box.</p>

<p>Riding so through the streets one day he came
upon Aderhold, his foot upon the doorstep of a
marked house. He drew rein. “Ha, the travelling
scholar!—Are you physician here?”</p>

<p>“Until the trouble is abated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Black enough trouble!” said the rider. “Toll, toll!
The place is more ghastly than a row of gibbets.”</p>

<p>“Abroad,” said Aderhold, “I have seen this sickness
in a far worse form. I have hopes that it will not
outlast the winter.”</p>

<p>The other smelled at his box of spices. “Do you
feel no fear, bending over their beds?”</p>

<p>Aderhold shook his head. “No. It is my calling.”</p>

<p>The man on horseback kept ten feet between
them and smelled continually at his silver box, but
for the rest was willing to stay and talk. “That
seems to be it. The soldier will run from the pest,
but face a cannon mouth. The sailor rocks upon a
masthead or boards a Spanish galleon with a cutlass
between his teeth, but a churchyard ghost turns
him into a whimpering child! Your thinker will
scale Olympus and enquire of Jove direct, but the
sight of torn flesh turns him pale. To each his courage
and each his fear! Each a master and each a
slave.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Aderhold briefly, “I know that well.”
He put his hand upon the door behind him. “I must
not stay.”</p>

<p>The other gathered up the reins. “I am dwelling
at the castle. When the plague is spent, and the air
again is clean and sweet, and old clothing has been
burned and new put on, then, before you travel
farther, come to see me there.—I have faced cannon
and fought a galleon. I would go far to have
speech with an authentic ghost. A brazen head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
would like me well, and I am constantly considering
new Dædalus’ wings. But to enter that house
behind you, and stand over that swollen, ghastly,
loathsomely smelling and moaning thing—no, no!
There I am your abject Eastern slave.”</p>

<p>He backed his horse farther from the house.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Aderhold, “I, too, have a great region
where Fear is my master and sets his foot upon my
neck! I will enter this house, but I make no talk of
Dædalus’ wings—seeing that the neighbours like
it not, and that they have the whip-hand!—When
all’s well I’ll come to the castle.”</p>

<p>The one rode away, the other entered the plague-touched
house. The first, returning home, found
company, come from the southward, and so reaching
the castle without passing through the town. An
old nobleman, father of the countess, was here, come
unexpectedly from the Court, and having no knowledge
of the family flitting. Now he was in an ill-humour,
indeed, and yet not very fearful of the
plague, and set upon resting his old bones before he
pursued his further journey. Mistress Borrow, the
housekeeper, promised to make him comfortable—there
were servants enough—“And your Lordship
will be glad to know that Sir Richard is here.” With
his lordship was a London physician of note, one that
had sometimes been called to the old Queen. For
years he had doctored his lordship; now, at special
invitation, he was making this journey with him.</p>

<p>That evening at supper the talk was almost solely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the plague. The physician had had experience in
London; he had written learnedly upon the subject,
and was reckoned an authority. He talked of preventives
and plague-waters, and hoped that while,
for his lordship’s sake, he should not think of
closely exposing himself, he might yet, with proper
precautions, descend into the town and observe the
general appearance of matters. He would be glad to
give to the authorities or to the physicians in the
place any advice in his power,—and then he fell to
the capon, the venison pasty, and the canary. The
old nobleman asked Sir Richard how he should get
word to William Carthew, living beyond Hawthorn
Village, of his presence at the castle. It seemed that
there was some tie of old service a generation agone,—Carthew’s
father had owed a captaincy and other
favours to the nobleman,—and now that he was
dead the present squire and justice always came
dutifully to see the great man upon the occasions
when he was at the castle. “They tell me that he
hath turned Puritan—or rather that his younger
brother hath turned Puritan and draggeth William
with him. A pack of crop-eared wretches! I should
have thought better of John Carthew’s son. I wish
to see him just to tell him so.”</p>

<p>“One of the grooms shall be sent to Hawthorn
to-morrow morning, sir. If your man be afraid of
infection he may ride around the town and come in
from this side.”</p>

<p>But the Carthews—for both brothers would ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
from Hawthorn to the castle—were not afraid of
infection. The older was unimaginative. As long as
you did not touch nor go too near, you were safe
enough. The younger brooded on other things, and
was sincerely careless of any danger riding through
the town might present. Neither was averse to seeing
how the stricken place might look. The younger,
who, truly, greatly influenced his brother, came with
him primarily that he might be at hand if the castle,
which was prelatical, opened upon religion.</p>

<p>It opened, but only in the person of the old nobleman.
Sir Richard sat a little to one side in the great
hall where the armour hung and listened as to three
actors in the same play. The physician standing by
the fire faintly shrugged his shoulders. The nobleman
ridiculed and vituperated, the younger Puritan—for
the elder was no match for his lordship—came
back with verse and Scripture. Finally the
first was reduced to “Insolent!” and a fine, foaming
rage. Squire Carthew plucked his brother’s sleeve.
“No, no, Harry! Don’t go so far—”</p>

<p>The younger Carthew made a stiff bow to his
lordship and stood silent. He had answered, he
knew, boldly and well, and it was much to him now
to answer well and know it, to feel that he had been
God Almighty’s able champion. In subtle ways it
tended to balance matters. It eased the sore and
fearful feeling within, the anguished sensation that
he was slipping, slipping, that the hand of Grace
was trembling beneath him....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The quarrel was too deep for any reconciliation.
The old nobleman advanced no olive branches.
Instead, with a “Fare you well, gentlemen! If this
goes much further in England there’ll be hangings
and beheadings!” he rose from his cushioned chair
and stalked from the hall. Sir Richard offered food
and canary, but the two Carthews misliked his suavity,
and the younger, at least, meant to keep no
terms of any kind. They refused entertainment.
They must needs at once return to Hawthorn.</p>

<p>“As you please, gentlemen!—I am glad to know
that the sickness has not touched your neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>The physician now came forward; they all stood
about the great table in the hall. “You are lucky if
it reaches you not,” said the London doctor. “I
understand that you are not more than six miles
away. But in great cities I have seen it skip one
parish and slay its hundreds all around. For some
reason the folk just there were more resistive.”</p>

<p>A servant entering with a message from the old
nobleman, he turned aside to receive it.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the younger Carthew with sternness,
“the plague falls where God would have it fall, and
falls not where he is willing to spare. He saith to his
Angel, ‘Smite here!’ or He saith, ‘Pass me by this
door!’—and where is the resistance of man that
you prate of? As well might the worm resist the
master of the vineyard’s treading foot!”</p>

<p>Sir Richard looked at him curiously. “Of course!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of course! Poor worm!” There fell a silence, then
the last speaker, unthinkingly, merely to make talk
to the great door before which stood the visitors’
horses, brought forward Aderhold’s presence in the
town. “Hawthorn hath played the Samaritan in
one person—though, I believe, indeed, that he lives
beyond the village. You’ve given a good leech. I
saw him yesterday morning in the town, going from
sick to sick.”</p>

<p>The squire spoke. “You mean one Gilbert Aderhold?
Yes, he is a leech. But Hawthorn sent him
not—”</p>

<p>The London physician, returning at the moment,
caught the name, “Gilbert Aderhold!—What!
I’ve wondered more than once what became of the
man—if, indeed, you speak of the same—”</p>

<p>“A tall, quiet man,” said Sir Richard. “A
thinker who has travelled—”</p>

<p>“It has a sound of him,” said the physician. He
somewhat despised the two country gentlemen, so he
addressed himself exclusively to Sir Richard. As to
what followed, it must be said that he spoke alike
without malice and without forethought. Indifferentist
himself, dulled by personal vanity and complacence
of position, and with a knowledge at least of
the tolerant-mindedness of the person to whom he
spoke, he possibly took not into consciousness at all
the very different nature of the two who might be
listening, nor realized that the man of whom he spoke
dwelled in their bailiwick and not in the town. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
any rate, he spoke on with vivacity. “A man of
abilities who should have risen—studied in Paris—was
for a time in the Duke of ——’s household.
Then what must he do but grow atheist and begin
to write and teach! ‘The God of Isaac and Jacob,
Isaac and Jacob’s idea of God. God the vast abstraction,
like and differing with all times and peoples.
The Bible not writ by the finger of God, but
a book of Eastern wisdom with much that is gold,
and much that is not.—No Fall of Man as therein
told.—Salvation out of the depths of yourself and
not by gift of another.—No soul can be bathed
clean by another’s blood.’—His book,” said the
physician, “was burned in an open place in Paris by
the common hangman, and he himself lay a long
while in prison and was hardly dealt with, nay, just
escaped with life—which he might not have done
but for the Duke of ——, who got him forth from
France with a letter to Sir Robert Cecil, and—seeing
that I had brought his Grace up from an illness
which he had when he was in England—one
from his secretary to me. But naturally neither Sir
Robert nor I could do aught—”</p>

<p>Sir Richard, his brow clouded, stopped him with a
gesture. “You caught my interest and held me fast—but
I should have checked you at once! Now—”
He bit his lip, his brows drawn together with deep
vexation.</p>

<p>The two men from Hawthorn were standing stone
still. In the elder’s face, at once stolid and peremptory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
was only single-minded amazement and wrath.
What was this that Justice Carthew and all Hawthorn
had been harbouring? A Jesuit spy would
have been bad enough—but atheist!—But the
younger was more complex, and in him a number of
impulses were working. He left it to the elder to
speak, who did so, explosively. “Atheist! No one
hath thought well of the man of late—but atheist!—I
will promise you, doctor—I will promise
you, Sir Richard—”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Sir Richard, no longer with suavity,
“what I would have you promise, that I know you
will not!” He shook himself like a great dog.
“Unhappy!”</p>

<p>The two Carthews rode down the castle hill and
through the town where people went dully to and
fro with Fear in company. There rose the pungent
smell of burning wood, a church bell made a slow
and measured clangour. They passed between tall,
gloomy, jutting houses, passed the prison with the
stocks and pillory, and the great church with the
sculptured portal, wound down to the river, and
crossed the arched bridge. Before them rolled the
yet wintry country. Mounting a hill, they saw on
the horizon a purple-grey line that was Hawthorn
Forest.</p>

<p>The younger Carthew spoke. “It comes back to
me.... That night at the Rose Tavern when he so
suddenly appeared beside old Hardwick.... Master
Anthony Mull, of Sack Hall, who was travelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
with us, appeared to recognize him and flew out
against him.... Wait a moment!—his very words
will come back. He said—’Black sorcerer and
devil’s friend!’”</p>

<p>That afternoon a serving-man brought to a
house at the foot of the castle hill a letter to be
passed on by a safe hand to the physician from
Hawthorn. It came into Aderhold’s hand as dusk
was falling. He broke the seal and read by the light
of one of the street fires. The letter—no lengthy
one—came from his friend of the hawk and the
silver box. It told him what the London physician
had betrayed, though without malice, and to whom.
It argued that it might be well to quit as quickly as
possible this part of the country, or even to go forth
for a time from England. It offered a purse and a
horse; also, if it were wished for, a letter of commendation
to the captain of a ship then lying at
anchor at the nearest port, which captain, his own
vessel being for longer voyages, would get him passage
in some other ship touching at a Dutch port—“Amsterdam
being to-day as safe as any place for a
thinker—where no place is safe.” The letter ended
with “The younger Carthew will move, no fear!
Then, my friend, move first.”—An answer was to
be left at the house at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>Aderhold mechanically folded the letter and
placed it in the breast of his doublet. The fire was
burning in an almost deserted street. Beside it was
a bench where an old tender of fires sat at times and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
nodded in the warmth. He was not here now. Aderhold
moved to the bench and sat down. He sat
leaning forward, his hands clasped and hanging, his
head bowed. After a time he sighed, straightened
himself, and turning upon the bench looked about
him. It was a gusty twilight with now and again a
dash of rain. He looked up and down the solemn
street. Some of the houses stood dark, those who
had lived in them dead or fled. Behind the windows
of others candles burned and shadows passed. This
house he knew was stricken, and this and that.
Here it was a child, here a young man or woman,
here older folk. In more than one house there were
many cases, a whole family stricken.... As he sat
he heard the first cart of the night roll into the street,
and a distant, toneless cry, “Bring out your dead!”</p>

<p>He rose and stood with a solemn and wide gesture
of his hands. He waited a moment longer by the
fire, then turned and went from this street into the
next, where there lived behind his shop an old stationer
and seller of books with whom he had made
acquaintance. Here he begged pen and ink and
paper, and when he had them, wrote, at no great
length, an answer to the letter in his doublet. The
next morning he left it at the house indicated,
whence in due time it was taken by the serving-man
and carried to Sir Richard at the castle. The letter
spoke of strong gratitude, “but it befits not my
calling to leave the town now.”</p>

<p>The days lagged by in the stricken place. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
suddenly, the black finger shot out again and
touched a house beyond the midway farm, so much
nearer than it to Hawthorn Village.... A week of
held breath and the finger went forward again. This
time it touched a house in Hawthorn.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">HERON’S COTTAGE</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was early spring again, and on the fruit trees pale
emerald buds of yet unfolded leaves. The blackbirds
came in flocks to the ploughed fields. But this year
there were many fields that were not ploughed;
dead men could not plough, nor those who had been
to death’s door and were coming halting, halting
back.</p>

<p>Joan sat in her kitchen, on a low stool by the
hearth. The room was clean, with shafts of sunlight
slanting in. But her wheel was pushed back into a
corner, and there lacked other signs of industry.
She sat still and listless, bent over, her cheek resting
upon her knees, and with her forefinger she made
idle marks and letters in the ashes. The fire was
smouldering out, the place seemed deadly still.</p>

<p>There came a knock upon the door. She raised her
head, and sat with a frozen look, listening. After a
minute the knock was repeated. Rising, she moved
noiselessly across the floor to the window, and, standing
so that she could not be seen, looked out. The
rigour passed from her face; she drew a breath of
relief and went and opened the door.</p>

<p>The sunshine flooded in and in the midst of it
stood Aderhold. He looked at her quietly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
kindly. “I came again but to see if you were well
and lacked naught.”</p>

<p>“I lack naught, thank you, sir,” said Joan. “And
I am well—O me, O me, I would that it had taken
me, too! O father, father!”</p>

<p>She leaned against the wall, shaken with dry sobs.
The fit did not last; she was resolute enough. She
straightened herself. “I’ve done what you told me
to. Yesterday I washed and cleaned and let the sun
in everywhere, and burned in the room the powder
you gave me. Everything is clean—and lonely.
No, I don’t feel badly anywhere. I feel terribly
strong, as though I would live to be an old woman....
I miss father—I miss father!”</p>

<p>“It looks so clean and bright,” said Aderhold,
“and your cat purring there on the hearth. Your
father went very quickly, and without much suffering.
His presence will come back to you, and you
will take comfort in it. You will feel it in this
room, and upon this doorstep, and out here among
the fruit trees, and under the stars at night.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Joan, “I think it too. But now—”
She stood beside him on the doorstep, looking out
past the budding trees to the gate and the misty
green twisted path that led at last to the village
road. Overhead drove a fleecy drift of clouds with
islands of blue. “All last night the countryside
mourned low and wailed. It was the wind, but I
knew it was the other too! It is sad for miles and
miles to be so woeful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“The sickness is greatly lessening. By the time
the spring is strongly here it will be over and Hawthorn
beginning to forget.—You have been here
now three days alone. Has no one come to enquire
or help?”</p>

<p>“Mother Spuraway from beyond the mill-race
came. No one else.”</p>

<p>“In a time like this all fear all. But presently
friends will find out friends again.”</p>

<p>“It is not that way that I am lonely,” said Joan.
“There are some that I care not if they never
come.”</p>

<p>He had his round to go. The sickness in the town
dwindling, he had come back, when it broke over
Hawthorn, to the Oak Grange. Since then he had
gone far and near, wherever it struck down the
poorer sort. As he turned from the cottage door,
Joan stepped, too, upon the flagged path, and they
moved side by side toward the gate, between the
lines of green lance-heads the daffodils were thrusting
above the soil. They moved in silence, almost of
a height, two simply, almost poorly dressed figures,
each with its load of sorrow and care for the morrow.
And yet they were not old, and about them was the
low ecstatic murmur of winter swiftening into spring.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” asked Aderhold, “that day
when we chanced to meet in the forest and Master
Harry Carthew came upon us?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Joan, “I remember.”</p>

<p>“Since then we have neither met nor spoken together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
until last week when your father was stricken
and you watched for me coming from the village.—And
now to-day I come only for this moment and
will come no more.—Have you no close friends nor
kindred?”</p>

<p>“They are buried with father.... I mean to stay
on here and spin flax and keep myself. And if—I
mean to stay.” Her hand went out to touch the
eglantine growing by the beehives. “I love it and I
mean to stay.”</p>

<p>Aderhold looked beyond at the wavy green path
and the massed trees of the forest. He, too, loved
this country. He had thought much here—once
or twice the light had shone through. But he was
ready now to go. Just as soon as there was no more
sick, just as soon as the plague was gone, he meant to
steal from the Oak Grange and Hawthorn countryside.
He and Joan came to the little gate, and he
went out of it, then turning for a moment looked
back at the thatched cottage, the pleasant beehives,
the fruit trees that ere long would put forth a mist of
bloom. Joan stood with a sorrowful face, but grey-eyed,
vital. Her hand rested upon the worn wood.
He laid his own upon it, lightly, for one moment.
“Good-bye,” he said, “Mistress Friendly-Soul!”</p>

<p>She stood in the pale sunshine until he was gone
from sight, then turned and went back to her
kitchen. She must bake bread; there was nothing for
her to eat in the cottage. She must get water from
the well. She took her well-bucket, went forth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
brought it back brimming. From the faggot pile she
fed the fire, then brought to the table coarse flour
and other matters for the bread, mixed and worked,
moulded and set to bake. And all the time she tried
to feel that her father was sitting there, in the settle
corner. She made the table clear again, then looked
at her wheel. But she did not feel like spinning; her
heart was burdened again; she sat down on the stool
by the fire and bowed her head in her arms. “Day
after day and day after day,” she said; “day after
day and day after day.” She rocked herself. “And
a powerful man that I hate to come again and yet
again to trouble me, and father not here.... Day
after day and day after day.... And I know not
why it is, but I have no friends. They’ve turned
against me, and I know not why.... Day after day—”
She sat with buried head and rocked herself
slowly to and fro. Save for the youth in her form
and the thick, pale bronze of her braided hair, she
might have seemed Mother Spuraway, or Marget
Primrose, or any other old and desolate woman.
She rocked herself, and the faggot burned apart, and
the cat stretched itself in the warmth.</p>

<p>From outside the cottage came a thin calling.
“<i>Joan! Joan! Oh, Joan!</i>”</p>

<p>Joan lifted her head, listened a moment, then rose
and opened the door. “<i>Joan! Joan! Oh, Joan!</i>”
She stepped without and saw who it was,—Alison
Inch and Cecily Lukin calling to her from the green
path well beyond the gate. They would come at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
first no nearer. The plague had struck in the Lukin
cottage no less than in Heron’s, and for weeks it had
closely neighboured Alison Inch and her mother.
But Joan must be made to feel comrades’ terror of
her. “Joan! Joan! Have you got it yet?—We
want but to see if you’re living!”</p>

<p>With a gesture of anger Joan turned to reënter
the cottage.</p>

<p>But Alison did not wish that. “Joan! Joan! We
were laughing. We’re not afraid if you don’t come
very close.—I’ve got something to tell you. See!
I’m not afraid.”</p>

<p>Alison came to the gate, Cecily with her. Joan no
longer liked Alison, and with Cecily she had never
had much acquaintance. But they were women and
young, and the loneliness was terrible about her.
She went halfway up the path toward them. The
grey and white cat came from the cottage and followed
her.</p>

<p>Alison regarded her with a thin, flushed, shrewish
face and an expression lifted, enlarged, and darkened
beyond what might have seemed possible to
her nature. But Alison had drunk deep from an acrid
spring that drew in turn from a deep, perpetual
fount. She spoke in a thin and cutting voice.
“Watching and weeping haven’t taken the rose
away.—What are you going to do now, Joan?”</p>

<p>“I do not think,” said Joan, “that it is necessary
to tell thee.” She looked past her to Cecily. “They
say your sister died. I am sorry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>But Alison had put poison into Cecily’s mind.
“Yes, she died. They do say that you would not be
sorry if more of us died. Why people like you and—and
Mother Spuraway should wish harm to us
others—”</p>

<p>“What are you talking of?” said Joan. “I wish
no harm to any—”</p>

<p>Cecily was an impish small piece with no especial
evil in her save a teasing devil. “Oh, they say that
you and a black man understand each other! Some
boys told me—”</p>

<p>“Nay, that’s naught, Cis!” said Alison impatiently.
She came closer to the gate, and Joan, as
though drawn against her will, approached from her
side. “Joan—nay, don’t come any nearer, Joan—”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“There’s one ill at the squire’s house. Ah!” cried
Alison. “Do you look joyful?”</p>

<p>“No—no!” stammered Joan.</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, shaken and unstable as she was
to-day, she gave back a step, lifted her hands to her
forehead. As for Alison—Alison had not expected
Joan to look joyful. She had spoken, burning her
own heart, to make Joan feel the hot iron, knowing
that the pang she gave would not be lasting, for
truly it was but one of the maidservants at the great
house that was stricken and not that person of overshadowing
importance. She had believed with all
her heart that it would smite Joan to the heart until
she told her true—and now there had been in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
face an awful joy, though at once it had shrunk back
and something piteous had come instead. But it was
the first look with which Alison was concerned.
There went through her a keen hope like a knife-blade.
Perhaps he no longer liked Joan!—perhaps
that made Joan angry, hurting her vanity—so,
perhaps she would have liked to hear that he was
sick of the plague! Alison stood astare, revolving
Joan’s look.</p>

<p>Cecily, who had never come before so close to
Heron’s cottage, gazed about her. “And Katherine
Scott says there’s something ‘no canny’ about the
bees in your beehives. She says she had them while
you were away to the castle, and they did naught
for her and made, besides, her own bees idle and sick.
But she says they make honey for you, great combs
of it—”</p>

<p>“There is none that is sick at the squire’s house,”
said Alison in a strange voice, “but Agnes, Madam
Carthew’s woman. They’ve taken her from the
house and put her in a room by the stable, and the
family goes freely forth.—Why did you look as you
were glad, Joan?”</p>

<p>“If I did, God forgive me!” said Joan. “In the
deep of me there is no ill-wishing.—Presently, the
leech says, it will be all safe here, as, indeed, it’s
clean and sun-washed and safe to-day. Then I hope
you’ll both come to see me—”</p>

<p>Cecily gave a gibing, elfin laugh. “Are you going
to live here all alone—like a witch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The grey and white cat had advanced beyond
Joan and now stood upon the sunny path between
the daffodil points. What happened none of the
three saw; perhaps a dog crossed the track behind
the two visitors, perhaps the creature recognized
human hostility—be that as it may, the cat suddenly
arched its back, its hair rose, its mouth
opened.</p>

<p>“Ah-h!” cried Cecily. “Look at her cat!”</p>

<p>A curious inspiration, not of light, passed like a
cloud-shadow over Alison’s face. “It doesn’t like
what you said, Cis! It’s her familiar.—Come
away! We’d best be going.”</p>

<p>They turned. Lightning came against them from
Joan’s grey eyes. “Yes, go! And come not here
again! Do you hear?—Come not here again!” Her
voice followed them up the green path. “Come not
here again—”</p>

<p>The next day she went to get wood from the edge
of the forest. She had gathered her load of faggots,
and was sitting upon them, resting, in her hand a
fallen bird’s nest, when Will the smith’s son happened
that way. The two had known each other to
speak to in a friendly way for many a year; it used
to be that, coming or going from the Grange, he
might at any time stop for a minute before the cottage
for a crack with old Heron and maybe with
Joan herself. That time had come to an end with
Joan and her father’s going to the castle; when they
came back he had been, as it were, afraid of new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
graces and manners. Moreover, old Master Hardwick
had presently died, and so Will left the employment
of the Grange and had little need any
more to come and go by Hawthorn Forest. It
might be that, save at church, they had not seen
each other for months. Moreover, he had been away
to the nearest port.</p>

<p>Now he greeted her with friendliness and an
honest-awkward speech of sorrow for old Heron’s
death. “He was a good man and, fegs! so learned!—Am
sorry for thee, Joan. And what will’t do
now?”</p>

<p>Joan turned the grey and empty nest in her
hands. “I do not know,” she said drearily; then,
with a backward fling of her shoulders and a lift of
courage, “The cottage’s mine. And I always sell
the flax I spin. I’ll bide and spin and keep the
place.”</p>

<p>Will shook his head compassionately. “A lass
like thou—! In no time thou’dst be talked of and
called ill names. Either thou must take service or
marry—”</p>

<p>Joan turned upon him heavy-lidded grey orbs.
“Why should I marry or be a serving-woman if I
wish neither, and can keep myself?—Oh, I like not
the way we’ve made this world!” She turned the
nest again. “This thing of ill names—Well, ill
names do not kill.”</p>

<p>Will stood, biting a piece of thorn. “You’d see
how it would turn out. No one would believe—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at her with rustic meditativeness. He
was slow and country-living; he had no great acquaintance
with Alison or Cecily, and it had never
occurred to him to mark Master Harry Carthew,
where the squire’s brother rode or whom his looks
pursued. He had heard of the vintner in the town,
and had dimly supposed that Joan would marry
him, or maybe the new huntsman or some other
fine-feathered person at the castle. But now the
plague had swept the town, and the vintner might
be of those taken—and here was old Heron gone.
He looked at her again, and the hand that held the
piece of thorn against his lips began to shake a little.
It occurred to him more strongly than it had done
before that she was a fair woman—and then,
Heron’s cottage. There was a tiny plot of ground,
the cow, some poultry. As things went, she had a
good dowry. Will the smith’s son might go farther
and fare worse. It was not the right time, all Hawthorn
being so gloomy and everybody afraid, and
his own heart knocking at times against his side with
fear. But it wouldn’t hurt just to drop a hint. He
moistened his lips. “Joan,” he said; “Joan—”</p>

<p>And then, by the perversity of her fortune, Joan
herself shook him from this base. She lifted sombre
eyes, still turning the little grey nest about in her
hands. “Why do you think we had the plague?
The minister preached that it was sent against the
town for its false doctrine, and we gave thanks that
we were not as the town.... And then in a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
while it was upon us, and my father, who was a good
man, took it and died....”</p>

<p>Gloom that had lifted this bright afternoon on the
forest edge settled again. Will the smith’s son had a
strong taste for the supernatural, all the emotional
in him finding that vent. It could grow to light up
with strange lightnings and transform every humdrum
corner of his mind. He liked to discuss these
matters and feel a wind of terror prick his temples
cold. He spoke oracularly, having, indeed, listened
to talk at the sexton’s the night before. “There’s always
an Evil Agent behind any pest, or a comet or
a storm that wrecks ships or blows down chimneys.
At times God uses the Evil Agent to punish the presumptuous
with—as He might give Satan leave to
spot with plague the town over yonder, seeing that
if it could it would have the old mass-priests back!
And at other times He gives the Evil Agent leave to
prick and try his chosen people that they may turn
like a wauling babe and cling the closer to Him.
And again there may be one patch of weed in the
good corn and Satan couching and holding his Sabbat
there. In which case God will send plagues of
Egypt, one after the other, until every soul wearing
the Devil’s livery is haled forth.—Now,” said Will,
and he laid it off with the sprig of thorn, “Hawthorn
is for the pure faith of the Holy Scriptures, so we
haven’t the plague for the reason the town hath it.—Again,
put case that so we’re to love the Lord the
more. Now Hawthorn and all to the north of it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
known for religion. I’ve been a traveller,” said Will
with unction, “and I know how we’re looked on,
clear from here to the sea, and held up to the ungodly!
Master Clement’s got a name that sounds to
the wicked like the trump of doom and Master
Harry Carthew isn’t far behind him—What did
you say?”</p>

<p>“I said naught,” said Joan.</p>

<p>Will closed his exposition. “Now it may be that
God wisheth to prick up Hawthorn to fresh zeal,
and, indeed, the sexton holds that it is so that Master
Clement interprets the matter. But it seemed to
me and the tinker, who was there talking, too, that
the third case is the likelier and that there are some
ill folk among us!” Will dropped the bit of thorn.
“It’s the more likely because there’s another kind of
mischief going around and growing as the plague
dies off. I know myself of three plough-horses gone
lame in one night, and Hodgson’s cow dying without
rhyme or reason, and a child at North-End Farm
falling into fits and talking of a dog that runs in and
out of the room, but no one else can see it. The
tinker”—Will spoke with energy—“the tinker
has come not long since over the border from Scotland.
He says that if Hawthorn was Scotland we’d
have had old Mother Spuraway and maybe others
in the pennywinkis and the caschielawis before
this!”</p>

<p>Joan rose and lifted her bundle of faggots to her
shoulders. The grey bird-nest she set between two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
boughs of the thorn tree. “What are the pennywinkis
and the caschielawis?”</p>

<p>“The one’s your thumbscrew,” said Will, “and
the other’s a hollow iron case where they set your
leg and build a fire beneath.”</p>

<p>Joan turned her face toward the cottage. Her old
acquaintance walked beside her. It was afternoon
and there was over everything a tender, flickering,
charming light. It made the new grass emerald, of
the misting trees veil on veil of soft, smiling magic.
Primroses and violets bloomed as though dropped
from immortal hands. The blue vault of air rose
height on height and so serene and kind....</p>

<p>Joan spoke in a smothered voice. “I would
believe in a good God.”</p>

<p>The young countryman beside her had gone on in
mind with the tinker and his talk. “What did you
say, Joan?”</p>

<p>“I said naught,” said Joan.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">HAWTHORN CHURCH</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Town</span> and village and all the country roundabout
were growing clean of the plague. Day by day the
evil lessened, the sickness stole away. It left its
graves, and among those whose loss was personal
its mood of grief. At large there was still a kind of
sullen fear, a tension of the nerves, a readiness to
attend to any cry of “Wolf!” The wolf might come
no more in the guise of the plague, but there were
other damages and terrors. All Hawthorn region
was in a mood to discover them.</p>

<p>It came Sunday. The danger, at least, of congregating
together seemed to have rolled away.
Comfort remained, comfort of the crowd, of feeling
people warm about you, gloomy comfort of
“Eh, sirs!” and shakings of the head. Hawthorn,
village and neighbourhood, flocked to church. Going,
the people drew into clusters. The North-End
Farm folk had a large cluster, and there the shaking
of the head was over the possessed boy. But
the widow whose cow was dead and the waggoner
whose horses were lamed had their groups, too, and
the largest group of all came compactly from the
lower end of the village, past the green and the
pond and the stocks and the Sabbath-closed ale-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with the tinker from Scotland talking in the
midst of it.</p>

<p>Dark stone, gaunt and ancient, rather small than
large, Hawthorn Church rose among yew trees.
Within was barer than without. What of antique
carving could be broken away was broken away,
what could be whitewashed was whitewashed, what
of austerity could be injected was injected. The
Act of Uniformity loomed over England like a
writing in the sky; there must be and was use of the
book of Common Prayer. But parishes minded
like Hawthorn used it with all possible reserves.
Where matters could be pared they were pared to
the quick; all exfoliation was done away with. As
far as was possible in an England where Presbyterianism
yet sat in the shadow of the Star Chamber
and the Independents had not arisen, idolatrousness
was excluded. Only the sermon was not pared.
Sunday by Sunday minister and people indemnified
themselves with the sermon.—You could not speak
against the King; except in metaphor you could not
speak against the Apostolic Succession; there were a
number of things you could not speak against unless
you wished to face gaol or pillory or worse. Because
of this the things that you could speak against
were handled with an added violence. The common
outer foe received the cudgellings you could not bestow
within the house. The Devil was mightily dealt
with in pulpits such as this of Hawthorn, the Devil
and his ministers. The Devil was invisible; even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
most materializing mind did not often get a glimpse
of him, though such a thing was possible and had of
course happened: witness Martin Luther and others.
But his ministers—his ministers! They were many
and palpable....</p>

<p>Hawthorn Church was filled. They sat very still,
men and women and children. They were peasants
and yeomen, small tradespeople, a very few of the
clerkly caste, one or two families of gentry. The
only great enclosed pew was that belonging by prescription
to Carthew House. The squire, the squire’s
wife, his young son, and the squire’s brother sat
there, where the force of the sermon could reach
them first. Quite at the back of the church sat Gilbert
Aderhold, a quiet, dark figure beside an old,
smocked farmer. Joan sat where she had been
wont to sit with her father, halfway down the
church, just in front of Alison Inch and her mother.
It was a dark day, the air hot, heavy, and oppressive,
drawing to a storm.</p>

<p>Master Thomas Clement came into the pulpit
wearing a black gown. He opened his Geneva Bible
and laid it straight before him. He turned the hourglass,
then lifting his hands to the lowering sky he
smote them together, and in a loud, solemn and
echoing voice read from the book before him, “<i>If
there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of
dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder. And the
sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake to
thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, that thou hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
not known, and let us serve them.... That prophet or
that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death; because he
hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God....
And all Israel shall hear and fear and shall do no
more any such wickedness as this is among you....</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>... There shall not be found among you any one
that ... useth divination, or an observer of times, or an
enchanter, or a witch, or a consulter with familiar
spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.</i>”</p>

<p>He ceased to read, and with another gesture of
his long, thin hands, began to preach. He had a
peculiar power and calibre had Master Thomas
Clement. He stood in his black gown, a small man
with a pale face; then his dire vision came upon him
and it was as though his form gained height and
dilated. He burned like a flame, a wind-tossed flame,
burning <i>blue</i>. When he spoke his words came with a
rushing weight. His figure bent toward the people,
his lean hands quivered above his head, gesturing
against the dark concave of the roof. The roof
might have been an open, stormy sky, the pulpit a
rock upon some plain of assemblage, the preacher a
gaunt, half-clad Israelite shrilling out to the Hebrew
multitude the rede of their lawgivers. <i>Thou shalt not
suffer doubt to live! Thou shalt endure no speech of
more or other paths than this one. He that differeth, he
shall die!</i></p>

<p>But it was not Sinai and some thousands of years
ago and an Asiatic tribe struggling back from Egypt
to some freehold of its own, or Asiatic lawgivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
building a careful theocracy. It was Europe,—it
was England and the seventeenth century,—and
still men like this stood in fiery sincerity and became
mouthpieces for that people and its history and its
laws. The order to Judah and Simeon and Levi
rolled through the ages like never-cooling lava, withering
and whelming vineyards of thought. <i>Thou
shalt not suffer doubt to live. He that differeth, he shall
die!</i>—And a thousand thousand pale shapes might
rise to the inner eye and speak to the inner ear.
“<i>We died.</i>”</p>

<p>Aderhold sat still, far back in Hawthorn Church.
In his own mind he saw that he was on the edge
of the abyss. He doubted much if he would escape....
The old farmer sitting, blue-smocked, beside
him, his watery eyes fixed upon the minister, broke
now and again into a mutter of repetition and comment.
“Aye, aye! The misbeliever to perish for
idolatry.... Of course he blasphemes—the misbeliever
blasphemes.... Aye, aye! ‘Why,’ and
‘Wherefore,’ the Devil’s own syllables.... Aye,
aye! Unbelief and sorcery go together.... Aye,
now we’re at fire in this world and everlasting, lasting
fire to come!”</p>

<p>The preacher had before him a people who had
come through a narrow strait and a valley of the
shadow, gathered together in a mood of strained
nerves, of twitches and starts aside, of a readiness to
take panic. The day was dark with heat and oppression,
a sense of hush before tempest. It was a day on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
which it was easy to awaken emotion. The faces of
the people showed pale in the dusk, breathing became
laboured. At last it grew that men and women
looked aside with something like a shudder and a
sigh in the dimness. It was as though they looked
to see a serpent’s head, fanged and crowned, lifting
itself in the gloom from monstrous coils. Aderhold
saw the slow turning of eyes in his direction.</p>

<p>He thought swiftly. He had served many in this
congregation. Since, in the winter-time, his eyes had
been opened, he knew of the drifting talk of his
hoarding gold, of his practising alchemy there in the
dark Oak Grange, alchemy, and perhaps worse.
Even after his return from the plague-stricken town,
even in his going through Hawthorn countryside
from house to house where there were sick, helping,
serving, even then he had seen doubtful looks, had
known his aid taken hurriedly, as it were secretly
and grudgingly. But all had not done so. There had
been those too simple and too suffering and sorrowful
for that, and there had been those whose minds
seemed not to have taken the dye. There were some
in this church of whom, in the years he had dwelt in
this country, he had grown fond; folk that of their
own bent felt for him liking and kindness.... But
he did not deceive himself. He knew of none that
would stand before this parching and withering
wind. Heretofore the talk might have been idle
talk, but now it was evident that Master Clement
had at his shaken finger-ends the history in France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of Gilbert Aderhold. Friends! By what multitude
of written words, of hearsay and legend—by what
considerable amount of personal observation did
he know how friends fell away from the denounced
dreamer of dreams!... Poor friends! He felt no
rise of bitterness against them. They would not
have fallen away in physical battle; they would
have stood many a strain, perhaps all but this.
This was not to cow the blood; it was to cow mind
and the immortal spirit. To face for a friend a wolf,
a lion, or an earthly angered King, that was well!—but
to face for a friend an angered God, to save
him not from hell-fire and to be yourself whelmed,
remediless, for eternity! Few there were who could
inwardly frame the question, “Is He angered?” or
“What is He that can be so angered?” or “You
who would silence this man with the silence of death,
are you beyond doubt the spokesmen of God and
Eternity? Are you, after all, <i>God’s</i> Executioners?”
But they said that they were, and the human mind
was clay to believe.... Aderhold looked over the
church and thought he saw none who would not be
terrified aside.</p>

<p>Well! he asked those questions and other questions.
Mind and moral nature rose in him and stood.
But he knew that his body would betray him if it
could. Highly strung, very sensitive to pain, he possessed
an imagination and memory vivid to paint or
to bring back all manner of pangs and shrinkings of
the earthly frame. No detail of any Calvary but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
some wise he knew and feared it. He felt the cold
sweat dew his temples and break out upon the backs
of his hands. He felt the nausea that numbed and
withered the brain and brought the longing for
death....</p>

<p>Not in the beginning, the middle, or the ending of
his white-heated discourse did the minister call the
name of Gilbert Aderhold or say the Oak Grange.
The invective, the “Lo, this is he that troubleth
Israel!” only drew in circles, closer, closer, until
there was no one there who did not know who was
meant. The tremendous accusation was of Atheism,
but in and out there tolled like a lesser bell,
<i>Sorcery! Sorcery!</i> The withdrawing light, the hot,
small, vagrant breaths of air, announcers of the
onward rolling storm, the darkened hollow of the
building with the whitewashed walls glimmering
pale, the faces lifted from the benches, the square
Hall pew, the high pulpit and the black sounding-board
and the black figure with the lifted arms and
the death-like shaken hands, and in the back of the
church, all knew, even if they could not see him, the
man who had made pact with the Devil.... A
woman fainted; a child began a frightened, whimpering
crying. The sands had quite run out from the
upper half of the hourglass....</p>

<p>Aderhold, close to the door, was the first of the
congregation to step from the church into the open
air. It would seem that those near him held back,
so as to let the fearful thing forth and out. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
churchyard path stretched bare before him, between
the yews to the mossed gate, and so forth
from the immediate pale. There came as yet no
challenge or molestation. He had looked for this;
when all had risen and he with them, it had been
with an inward bracing to meet at the door a writ of
arrest. He looked to see the Hawthorn constable.
But he was not at the door, or out upon the path,
or at the gate.... The storm was at hand, with
clouds heavy and dark as the yew trees and with a
mutter of thunder. As he reached the village street,
raindrops touched his face. Behind him the churchyard
was astir with people, murmuring and dark.
He wrapped his cloak about him, pulled his hat
down against the rain, and faced homeward. Almost
immediately, the church being at the village
end, the cloud-shadowed country was about him.</p>

<p>He walked rapidly for half a mile, then halted and
stood in the wind and rain, trying to think it out. It
occurred to him that he might turn back through the
fields and passing the village come out on the highway
and strike southward to the town and the castle.
He knew not if his friend of the hawk were yet at the
castle. And if he were not?—and if he were?...</p>

<p>There was that at the Oak Grange which must be
considered. His book—there in the quiet room
behind the cupboard’s oaken door, all his writing
lying there—that which he was trying to put down.
It turned him decisively from the town and the bare
chance of reaching help. His book was his lover and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
playmate and child. He put himself into motion
again and went on toward the Grange, beneath the
tempestuous sky, through the wind and the rain....
When he came within Hawthorn Forest there
arrived a sudden lull. The oaks stood still around
him, the raindrops fringing branch and twig and
unfolding tufts of velvet leaves. Overhead the
clouds drove apart, there came a gleam of intensest
blue. As he moved through the forest it took on an
ineffable beauty. When he came to the edge and to
the stream murmuring over its pebbly strand there
was a great rainbow. He crossed the footbridge and
went on by the fairy oak.</p>

<p>Within the still old house was none but himself.
Dorothy and the boy, her nephew, had been there
in Hawthorn Church. They would come on but
slowly; indeed, they might have stopped at a cousin’s
on the way; indeed, he knew not if, terrified
and at a loss, they would come back to the Grange
at all. They might, perhaps, have waited to beseech
the minister’s and the squire’s protection and advice.
There was a fire in the kitchen. Aderhold,
spreading his cloak to dry, knelt upon the hearth,
crouched together, bathed by the good warmth.
But even while the light and comfort played about
him there came into his mind, suddenly, with sickening
strength, a thing that he had witnessed in his
childhood, here in England. Again he saw a woman
burning at a stake.... He shuddered violently, rose
and left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Upstairs he unlocked the cupboard and took from
it a heap of closely covered manuscript. It rested
upon the table before him.... He stood for some
moments with a bowed head; presently his hand
stole to the leaves and caressed them. He knew what
he should do; he should take the whole down to the
kitchen and lay it in the fire. Since the warning of
the man with the hawk he had known that that
was what should be done. The knowledge had lain
upon his heart at night. “I will do it to-morrow,”
and again, “I will do it to-morrow.” The only other
thing was to hide it in some deep and careful place,
whence, if ever there came escape and security, he
might recover it, or where, long years after he was
dead, men might find it and read it. He had thought
of digging beneath the fairy oak—but the fire, he
knew, was the safest.... He gathered all together
and with it in his hands went downstairs. He
thought that he had decided upon the fire, but
going, he had a vision of a mattock and spade
resting behind an outhouse door. Now would be
the time to dig, now at once! As his foot touched
the oak flooring of the hall there sounded a heavy
knock upon the door. It was not locked or barred;
even as he stood the one uncertain instant, it swung
inward to admit the men who had followed him
from Hawthorn.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">NIGHT</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">The</span> storm that had broken in the early afternoon
regathered. The clouds hung low and black, the
wind whistled, the rain came in gusts, now and again
there was lightning and thunder. It was so dark in
Heron’s cottage, behind the deep, dripping eaves,
that Joan moving to and fro seemed a shadow
among shadows. The hearth glowed, but she held
her hand from making a bright light with fresh faggots.
Her mood was not for the dancing flame.</p>

<p>What it was for she knew not. She only knew
that she was suited by the rain that dashed, by the
bending fruit trees, striking the thatch with mossed
boughs, the solemn roll of the thunder, the darkness
and solitude. She paced the room, her arms lifted
and crossed behind her head. At last a bit of unburned
wood caught and sent up forked flames.
Light and shadow danced about the walls. The
grey and white cat came and walked with Joan,
rubbing against her skirt.</p>

<p>The thunder rolled. Outside, the murk of the day
thickened toward evening. A hand fell across the
door, then pressed the latch. The door swung inward;
there was a vision of a muffled figure, behind it wind-tossed
trees and up-towering clouds lit by lightning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is it?” Joan cried sharply; then, as the
man let drop the cloak he had been holding across
his face, “Master Carthew!...”</p>

<p>The firelight, sinking, left only the smouldering
coals and the room almost dark. Joan, moving
swiftly across the room, seized fresh brands and
threw them upon the old. A flame leaped up; the
place was fairly light again. She turned upon him.
“To come here—to come here—”</p>

<p>“Aye,” he answered, “to come here.” He unclasped
his great cloak and let it drop on the settle,
took off his steeple-crowned hat and set it on
the cloak. He stood out, dark-clothed, plain as Master
Clement himself in what he wore, with short-cut
hair, with handsome features, haggard, flushed,
and working. “Do you know whence I have come?
I have come from leading men to the Oak Grange
where they took and bound that atheist there and
carried him away to gaol. You’ll walk no more
with him in Hawthorn Forest.”</p>

<p>Joan drew a heavy, painful breath. “I walked
little with him in Hawthorn Forest. But when my
father took the plague he came to him. He is a good
man! Aye, I was in church and heard Master
Clement—”</p>

<p>“Nay, I think that you walked much. But now
you will walk no more.” He came nearer to her.
“Joan, put that Satan’s servant from out your
mind! Turn instead to one who sinneth truly and
puts oftentimes in peril his immortal soul, but is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
at least no misbeliever and denier of God’s Word.
Joan—Joan!”</p>

<p>He tried to take her in his arms. She was strong
and broke from him. Behind her was a shelf with
some pewter jugs and dishes and small articles of
use. She put up her arm and snatched from it a
good and keen hunting-knife; then stood, breathing
quickly, the firelight reddening the blade in her
hand.</p>

<p>He gave a harsh and forced laugh. “Put it down,
Joan! I did not mean to fright thee. I came to
persuade—”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’ll keep it by me,” said Joan. “Persuade
me to what? To feel love for you? That, Master
Carthew, you cannot do! But you could make me
feel gratitude—”</p>

<p>“If I took hat and cloak and went from out your
door?”</p>

<p>“Aye, just.”</p>

<p>“I cannot.... No man ever loved as I love you....
Here, this dusk, this Sabbath.—Think if I
am in earnest.... Joan, Joan! If I lose for thee
my immortal soul—”</p>

<p>She made a sound of anger and contempt. “Oh,
thy little immortal soul! Be but mortal—and
just!” The tears rose in her grey eyes. “See what
you will do to me! Say that you were seen coming
here—say that any of the times you have waited for
me, waylaid me, met me against my will, you were
watched—we were seen together.... You are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
man and a gentleman and a great man in this
country. It will not harm you. But Joan Heron—but
Joan Heron—it will harm her! It will provide
her misery for all her days!”</p>

<p>Carthew struck his hand against the settle. “Is
not all my name and future risked? I am not of the
old England, nor of to-day’s careless and idolatrous
England. My world is the world of the new England,
of the forces of the Lord mustering upon the
straight and narrow path where there is no room for
Satan’s toys! And if I turn aside to Babylon and the
flesh and its madness, and if my turning becomes
known—Joan, Joan, you know not how great is my
risk—even my worldly risk! As for the other—as
for my risk of God’s hatred and damnation—but I
will not speak of that.... Enough that I am here,
and that to hold you consenting in my arms would
even all out and make my lead gold and my torment
bliss! Joan—if you would but love me and feel how
the risk is outweighed! As for security, we can manage
that. Many another pair has managed that.
To-day—here—with the wind and rain keeping
all within doors.... I rode with the men some way
toward the town, and then I left them, saying there
were matters at home that needed. When they were
out of sight, I turned through the fields and went up
the stream that was all solitary, until I was over
against the Oak Grange and the forest all around
me. Then I turned and rode here through the forest,
and fastened my horse in a hollow out there where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
none may see him.... Joan, it is like a desert all
about us—or like Paradise garden. Joan, Joan, I
love you! Joan, have pity!”</p>

<p>There came an access of lightning with thunder
and a prolonged whistling of the wind. In the warring
light and darkness of the room, Carthew, as
though the final spring of restraint had snapped,
came close to her, put his arms about her. The
lightning blazed again, and by it both saw with distinctness
a man and woman standing without, their
faces close to the window. In the darkness after the
flash, they left it and came on to the cottage door,
but as yet did not knock. Within the room, Carthew,
sobered, the colour ebbing from his face, only
one consideration pouring in upon his mind, released
Joan and caught from the settle hat and
cloak. There was a second outward-opening door,
giving upon the bit of garden behind the cottage,
leading in its turn to the forest. He looked toward
it. She nodded, “Yes, yes, go!” He came close to
her, moving noiselessly and speaking low, “Do you
think they saw—saw at all?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I do not know.”</p>

<p>“It was too dusk within. I do not think they
saw. Keep counsel, Joan, for thy own sake if not
for mine.”</p>

<p>The two without knocked. Carthew crossed the
floor without sound, opened the forest-facing door,
and with a gesture of farewell vanished. There was
a continuous noise of wind and rain; what daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
was left and the lightning were all without; it might
truly be doubted if one glancing through the window
could either see or hear, the interior was so
dusky, the voice of wind and wet so continuing.
Joan, with a long, shuddering sigh, put down the
hunting-knife, and going to the door opened it.
The two who stood there were Will the smith’s son
and his mother. They had, it seemed, the weather
clearing, walked to see the forester’s people; then,
the clouds returning, they had taken their leave to
hurry home. But the storm had overtaken them—and
they had thought to take refuge until the rain
lessened in Heron’s cottage. But they did not
know—they thought they had better go on.</p>

<p>“Come in and warm and dry yourselves,” said
Joan.</p>

<p>They came in hesitatingly. They looked around
them, confused and doubtful. They sat on the settle
by the fire and stared at the grey and white cat.
Will was trembling, and it could not be from the wet
and chill, for he was used to that.</p>

<p>His mother was of stouter mental make. “Were
you alone, Joan? It seemed to us there was somebody
else—”</p>

<p>“Why, who else,” asked Joan, “could there have
been?” She looked around her. “The shadows
moving along the walls do look like people.”</p>

<p>“It looked,” said Will, in a strange voice, “as
though you and a shadow were locked and moving
together. It looked like a tall black man.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
stared at the fire and at the grey and white cat. A
fine, bead-like moisture that was not rain clung to
his brow, beneath his yellow elf locks.</p>

<p>“No, no black man,” said Joan. “I myself fancy
all kinds of things in a storm.”</p>

<p>Her woman guest was silent. She sat with bead-like
blue eyes now on Joan, now upon the kitchen
from wall to wall. But Will’s perturbation remained.
The events of the day, North-End Farm
talk and the tinker’s talk, the atmosphere of heat
and storm, church and the denunciation of his old
master’s kinsman, the physician with whom at the
Oak Grange he had himself been in daily contact,
the talk at the forester’s which had been of the marvellous,
indeed, and the evident power of Satan;
afterwards the dark wood, the lightning, rain, and
thunder, and then the momentary spectral vision
through the window, which now, it seemed, was
naught—all wrought powerfully upon his unstable
imagination. There flowed into his mind his long-ago
adventure with the wolf that ran across the
snow-field, and was trapped that night but never
found ... but old Marget Primrose was found with
her ankle cut. The remembrance dragged with it
another—he was again with that same physician
sitting his horse before the portal of the great church
in the town—the carvings in the stone struck with
almost material force back into his mind that was
edged already with panic. <i>Witches and devils....</i>
And the tinker’s talk of how Scotland was beset,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and Satan buying women, old and young.... He
had always thought of witches being old like Marget
Primrose or like Mother Spuraway—but, of course,
they could be young.... The forester’s wife, that
afternoon, had said something—it hummed back
through his head. Her beehives were bewitched by
Joan Heron’s beehives....</p>

<p>His mind was tinder to every superstitious spark.
With a whistling breath and a shuffling of the feet,
he rose from the settle. “We’re dry and warm now,
mother.—Let’s be getting home.”</p>

<p>His mother, it seemed, was ready. Her parting
with Joan was somewhat tight-lipped and stony.
“Seeing that you are alone now in the world ’tis a
pity you ever had to leave living by the town and
the castle! There were fine strange doings there that
you miss, no doubt—”</p>

<p>The two went out into the declining day. The
rain had ceased, but the wind blew hard, driving
vast iron-grey clouds across the sky. However,
since the thunder had rolled away, one could talk.
As soon as the two were out of the cottage gate and
upon the serpentine green path, wet beneath the wet
trees, they began to talk.</p>

<p>“It was something,” said Will; “and then when
we got within, it was nothing.... Mother!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” said his mother. “It wasn’t to be
seen plain. But she was not by herself.”</p>

<p>“Mother ... the tinker saith that the Scotch
witches all have familiars. A man or a woman or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sometimes children see such and such an one walking
or talking with a tall black man, but when they get
close there is only, maybe, a dog, or a cat, or sometimes
a frog or a mouse.... But the witch-prickers
always find the witch’s mark where the Devil that is
her familiar sucks.... And then the witch confesses
and tells how the Devil is now tall and black
like himself and now shrinks into the small beast,
and how by his power she can herself change her
shape.”—Will shivered and his eyes glanced fearfully
about. “Mother, do you think that there was
something evil there?”</p>

<p>His mother looked steadily before her with beady
blue eyes. “I don’t know what I think. I think
there was somebody or something there that she
didn’t want seen or known about—but where it
went, or he went.... Don’t you think any more
that you might marry her.”</p>

<p>Back in Heron’s cottage Joan sat crouched before
the fire. She fed it now constantly with wood so as
to make the whole room light. A determination was
taking form in her mind. To-morrow she would
walk to the town, and climb the castle hill, and ask
for Mistress Borrow at the castle. The old housekeeper
had called her a pagan, but natheless she had
been fond of Joan and Joan of her.... Now to go to
the castle, and find her in the cheerful housekeeper’s
room and to sit on the floor beside her with head,
maybe, in her lap, and free a burdened heart and
mind and ask counsel.... She would do it. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
would start early—at sunrise. The vigour of her
purpose lightened her heart; she rose to her feet, and
going to the window, looked out. It was quite dark.
The storm had died away, but the sky was filled
with torn and hurrying clouds. Now hidden, now
silvering cloud and earth, a half-moon hurried too.
Joan stood gazing, her face lifted. She thought of
her father. At last she raised her arm, closed the
casement, and drew across it its linen curtain. From
the cupboard she took a candlestick and candle and
lighted the latter with a splinter from the hearth.
She set it upon the table, and going to the main door
turned the large key in the lock. This done, she
moved across the kitchen floor to the small door
giving upon the back. The key was lost of this, but
there was a heavy bar. She had lifted this to slip it
into place when the door, pushing against her,
opened from without. Carthew reëntered the room.</p>

<p>Joan uttered a cry less of fright than of sudden
and great anger. “Beware,” she cried, “that I do
not kill you yet! Begone from this place!”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “No. I have watched all
away. Who comes, after curfew, of a wet and wild
night, to your cottage? No good folk of this region,
I am sure. So we’re alone now, Joan, at last!”</p>

<p>He made a movement past her. She saw what he
was after, and, lithe and quick herself, she was there
first. She had the knife again.... They stood facing
each other in the lit room, and Joan spoke.</p>

<p>“Thou hypocrite!” she said; “thou pillar of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Hawthorn Church and dependence of God on high
and Master Clement! Thou hope of England!
Thou searcher-out of iniquity and punisher of
wrong-doing! Thou perceiver of high things and the
meaning of the world! Thou judge and master in
thy own conceit!—Thou plain and beast-like man,
who wantest but one thing and knows not love, but
lust—”</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms. He was strong, but
so was she. They struggled, swaying, their shadows,
in firelight and candlelight, towering above
them. They breathed hard—they uttered broken
words, ejaculations. He was in the grasp of the
brute past; she struggled with the energy of despair
and hatred. She felt that he gained. Need taught
her cunning. She seemed to give in his clasp, then,
in the moment when he was deceived, she gathered
all her strength, tore her arm free, and struck with
the hunting-knife.</p>

<p>The blade entered his side. She drew it out, encrimsoned.
They fell apart, Carthew reeling against
the wall. The colour ebbed from his face. He felt
the bleeding, and thrusting a scarf within his doublet,
strove to stanch it. As he leaned there, he kept
his eyes upon her. But with the suddenness of the
lightning their expression had changed. Wrath and
defeat and shame were written in them; desire still,
but mixed now with something baleful, with something
not unlike hate. The bleeding continued. He
felt a singing in his ears and a mist before his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>With the ice of the new mood came a sense of the
peril of his position. Did he swoon here from loss of
blood—grow so weak that he could not get away—be
found here when day came—. The scandal
flared out in letters of fire before him. He saw the
face of Master Clement, and the faces of other and
more powerful men of the faction, religious and political,
with which he was becoming strongly identified....
He must get away—get home—framing
some story as he went. His horse was near—the
streaming blood seemed less.</p>

<p>Joan stood like a dart, in her face blended relief
and horror. They stared each at the other.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” said Carthew in a hollow
voice, “in the forest there, I said that love might
turn to hate? Beware lest it has turned!”</p>

<p>“You may hate me,” said Joan. “You never
loved me.”</p>

<p>He took his eyes from her and moving haltingly to
the door opened it. His horse was close outside,
fastened within the small enclosure. Through the
dark oblong, by the light of the half-moon, she saw
him mount. He gathered up the reins, he held also
by the horse’s mane. His face looked back at her for
a moment, a ghastly, an enemy’s face. Then there
was only the mournful night and Heron’s cottage,
thatch-roofed, sunk among blossoming fruit trees
from which the raindrops dripped, dripped.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">NEXT DAY</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">At</span> sunrise she shut the cottage door behind her,
locked it, and put the key in a hiding-place under
the eaves, then went down the path between the
daffodils and out of the little gate. She had a basket
upon her arm and within it in a blue jar a honeycomb
for a gift to Mistress Borrow. It was a morning
fresh and fragrant, the grass diamonded with
last night’s rain, the tree-tops veiled with mist,
distant cocks crowing. When she came upon the
road the sun was drinking up the mist; it was going
to be a beautiful day.</p>

<p>She walked for some distance toward the village,
but at a point where she saw Carthew House among
the trees and the church yews were growing large
before her, she turned into a path that would take
her through the fields and bring her out upon the
highway with the village left behind. She did not
wish to go through the village, she did not wish to
pass Alison Inch’s door, she did not wish to come
near to Carthew House.</p>

<p>She walked between the springing grain, and
through a copse where a thrush was singing, and by
a stream that was the same that murmured past the
Oak Grange, and so at last came back to the highway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
She looked back. The village roofs, the church
tower, rested dark against the blue sky; light curls
of smoke were rising and a great bird sailed overhead.</p>

<p>Before her, over hill and dale, ran the road to the
town. She shifted her basket to the other arm and
walked on in the golden morning. Now she was by
nature courageous, and by nature also a lover of
light and air, of form and colour, of diverse motion
and the throb of life. In her soul the whole round
earth mirrored itself as alive, and, despite black
moods and fits of madness, as dominantly good and
fair. What of sorrow, gloom, and care had of late
clung about her, what of terror and horror the happening
of the evening before had left with her,
slowly lessened, grew diaphanous in the sunlight
and open country. The road began to entertain
her, and there came sweet wafted memories of the
castle wood, of how fondly she and her father and
uncle had lived together and understood one another
and liked life, and of all the pleasant doings
when the great family were at the castle. Music
hummed in her ears again, the figures of the masque
filed across the green sward.</p>

<p>In the fresh morning there was more or less meeting
and passing on the road. A shepherd with a
flock of sheep overtook her, and she stood under an
elm to let them by. The shepherd whistled clearly,
the sheep kept up their plaintive crying, pushing
and jostling with their woolly bodies, their feet making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a small pattering sound. “To market! To market!”
said the shepherd. “Are you for the market,
too, pretty maid?” Farther on she overtook in her
turn two or three children going on some errand and
walked with them awhile. They wanted to know
what was in her basket and she opened the jar and
showed them the bright honeycomb, then, breaking
clean skewers from a wayside hazel, dipped them in
the liquid gold and gave each child a taste. They
left her at a lane mouth, and she walked for a little
way with two women who were carrying between
them an old tavern sign painted with a sheaf of
wheat and a giant bunch of grapes. When she had
left these two behind and had gone some distance
upon a bare, sunny road, she saw before her like a
picture the river and the bridge, the climbing town
and the castle. She could make out the Black Tower
among the trees.</p>

<p>The town was quit of the plague. To the knowing
there would be still visible a gloom about the place,
a trailing shadow of remembered fear and loss.
People would be missed from the streets, vacant
houses and shops remarked. Street cries and
sounds would come more sombrely and the sunshine
fall less warmly. But to the stranger it would seem
a town as usual. For Joan, it was not so gay and
rich as once it had been, because she that looked on
it was not so care-free as once she had been. But
still it was to her the great town, so different from
Hawthorn, so jewelled with pleasant memories....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
She passed the vintner’s house and was glad to see
that it was open and cheerful, and that therefore he
had not died of the plague. At length she came to
climb the castle hill, and with her heart beating
fast to cross the pleasaunce and go around to a
certain small door of the offices through which she
would soonest gain admittance to Mistress Borrow.
The sky was so blue, the grass, the flowers, the budding
trees were so fair, mavis and lark and robin
sang so shrill and sweet, that earth and heaven
once more assumed for Joan a mother aspect.
Warm, not unhappy, tears came to her eyes. She
shook them back and went on over daisies and violets.
She had not slept last night and the miles
were long between her and Heron’s cottage. She
felt light-headed with the assurance of comfort and
counsel, the sense that the black cloud that had
gathered about her so strangely, so almost she knew
not how, would now begin to melt away.</p>

<p>Mistress Borrow was not at the castle. Her sister,
thirty miles away, was dying of a dropsy, and the
housekeeper had been given leave to go to her. She
had gone last week—she might be away a month....
The family were not there—they had gone at
the first alarm of the plague. Sir Richard had
stayed through it and my lord the countess’s father,
had stopped for a week, but they, too, were now
away.... It was a civil-spoken girl who told her all
this, a new maidservant who had no knowledge of
Joan. There were men and women servitors whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
she remembered and who would remember her, but
when the girl asked if, Mistress Borrow being away,
she could do her errand to any one else, she shook
her head. “You look dazed,” said the maid.
“Better come in and sit awhile.” But no, said Joan,
she must be getting home. So she thanked the girl,
and they said good-morning to each other, and she
left the little door and the flagged courtyard, and
coming out under an archway found herself again
upon the flower-starred grass, with the shadows of
the trees showing two hours from noon. To the
right stretched the castle wood, and she would go
through it and see again the huntsman’s house.</p>

<p>It rose among the trees before her, a comfortable,
friendly, low, deep-windowed place. She would not
go very near; she did not know the people who had
it now, and truly she felt dazed and beaten and did
not wish questioning or talk. She found an old,
familiar oak with huge and knotted roots rising
amid bracken, and here she sank down and lay with
her head upon her arm and her eyes upon the place
where in all her life she had been happiest. An old
hound came and snuffed about her, a redbreast
watched her from a bough. She lay for some time,
resting, not thinking but dreaming back. At last she
rose, settled the basket upon her arm, looked long
at the huntsman’s house, then turned away, and
leaving the wood began to descend the castle hill.</p>

<p>When she passed through the high street of the
town the church bells were ringing. She turned out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of the brighter street into one that sloped to the
river, and here she came upon an open place and the
prison tall and dark. She stopped short, standing in
the shadow of a bit of wall. It was easy for one’s
own cares to make one forget, and she had forgotten
Aderhold. But he would be here—there was no real
gaol in Hawthorn itself, though offenders might be
locked for a time in a dungeon-like room beneath the
sexton’s house. But a learned man and a property-owner
and a man accused of the greatest crime of
all, which was to deny the real existence and power
of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,—such
an one would be brought here. They would have
haled Master Aderhold here last night.... She
stood and gazed at the frowning mass. The windows
were few and far apart and small and closely
barred. To-day that was so sunshiny bright would
be stifling and black enough in there. She wished
that she could send in the light and air.</p>

<p>A man, coming, too, from the high street with his
course shaped for Hawthorn Village, joined her
where she stood. He was a wiry, crooked-shouldered,
grizzle-headed, poorly clad person with a face
of some knavery, cunning, and wildness. Over his
shoulder, strung together with leather thongs, hung
some small pots and pans, and in a leather pouch he
seemed to carry tools and bits of metal. Joan recognized
him for the tinker, who, after wandering far
and wide, came back, at long intervals, to a hut just
this side of Hawthorn. It appeared that on his part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
he remembered her face. “From Heron’s cottage,
mistress?—near the Oak Grange.” He seemed to
cast a glance upon the prison, but then he looked at
her grey eyes and her face, paler to-day than was its
wont, and asked if she had walked from home. She
said yes, she had been to see the housekeeper at the
castle—but she was not there. “Was she walking
back to Hawthorn?” Yes, she said, and began to
move across the prison square. He moved with her.
“I walked from Hawthorn myself this morning.
Matters to buy for my trade! Shall stop here at the
Boar’s Head before I take the road back.” To her
content he left her, and she went on by the great
church and down the hill to the arched bridge. But
when she had crossed it, and when the river behind
her lay thin like a silver crescent, she found him
again at her side.</p>

<p>It was hot midday and the road bare of folk. She
did not wish a travelling companion and would have
liked to tell him so, but she was somehow cowed this
noon, weary and listless where on the sunrise road
she had been hopeful. She let him walk beside her,
a freakish figure, vowed to mischief. Immediately
he began to talk about the plague. Her father had
died?—“Yes.”—He had been told so. Many
people had died—many people in the town, and
not so many, but enough in Hawthorn and roundabout.
Once he saw the plague. He was lying in
the heather on a hillside near a town that had it.
Dark was coming. Then a great figure of a woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
black and purple, with a veil all over, rose straight
up above the roofs and chimneys. She lifted her
arms and took the veil from her head, and it was
crowned with shiny gold and she was the Plague—and
she floated in the sky and took her veil and drew
it behind her, and every roof it touched they were
going to die in that house.—Yes, tinkers saw
strange things, wandering over the country. There
were a many strange things, weren’t there? The
plague left the country very fearful—and there
was another strange thing, Fear! It took a man and
knocked the heart out of him—but then to make
up, it gave him more eyes and ears than he’d ever
had before!</p>

<p>He looked at her aslant. “Did you ever see the
Devil?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you aren’t fearful,” said the tinker.
“Fearful folk can see him plain.”</p>

<p>He kept silence for a little, his eyes upon a cloud
of butterflies fluttering before them over a muddy
place in the road, then again turned upon Joan his
curious, half-squinting look. “Of course there’ve
been men who weren’t afraid and yet have seen
him. Men who were great enemies to him, and pushing
him hard, and he so angry and despairing that he
shows himself, tail, claws, and all! Tall Bible men
and great men like Doctor Martin Luther who
threw his ink-well at him. And a lot of other men—mass-priests,
and bishops, and marprelates, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the same. It’s to their honour to have seen him, for
so the people see how the Devil must hate them to
come himself to beard them, and what a strong
enemy they are to him, which means, of course, that
the King of Heaven must hold them in high regard.—Even
poor wights may sometimes give a
good blow—just as a camp-follower might save an
army or a scullion a palace! I’m not saying that
I didn’t get a glint of his horns myself once on
Little Heath, between two furze bushes!”</p>

<p>Joan was not talkative. She walked steadily on, but
she was tired, and her mind now seemed to drowse,
and now, rousing itself, strayed far from the other’s
talk.</p>

<p>The tinker was piqued by her inattention. “And
then witches and warlocks see him.—<i>Women</i> see
him,” he said with spite. “And not because they’re
his enemies neither! Ten women know him, hair
and hoof, to one man.... For why? They knew
him first, as the good Book tells us, and became his
gossips in Eden Garden. So ’tis that still when
things go wrong ’tis woman that gives them the
shog. The Devil gives her the apple still, and she
takes it and shakes out harm on mankind—which
is why we’ve got a leave to keep her somewhat
down! That’s woman in ordinary—and then you
come to witches—”</p>

<p>Joan’s eyelids twitched.</p>

<p>He saw that she attended. “Witches! First they
begin by having commerce with elves and fays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
green men, and such. They get into fairy hills and
eat and drink there, and they dance in the moonlight
around trees in the wood. But the elves are
the Devil’s cousins, and he’s always on hand, and
some night he comes smirking up, dressed now this
way and now that. So the woman drops a curtsy,
and he puts out his hand and gives her something,
just as he did in Eden Garden. She takes it, and
that seals her both sides of the Judgement Day!
Pay for pay! Blood gives him strength, and so he
sucks from a little place he makes upon her body—that’s
the witch mark that can’t be made to feel
pain, and that’s why we strip and prick witches to
find their mark, which is better proof even than
their confessing! Now she’s the Devil’s servant and
leman forever, and begins to work evil and practise
the Black Art. He shows her how to fly through the
air and change herself into all manner of shapes.
Then she goes to his Sabbat and learns to know other
witches and maybe a wizard or two, though there
aren’t so many wizards. They’re mostly witches
and demons. If you look overhead at night you can
sometimes see a scud of them flying between you and
the moon. Then begin the tempests of hail and
thunder and lightning, and the ships that are sunk
at sea, and the murrain in the cattle, and the corn
blighted and ricks burned and beasts lamed and
children possessed and gear taken and sickness
come—”</p>

<p>He stopped to cough and also to observe if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
were listening. She was listening. He was saying
nothing that she had not heard before. They were
commonplaces alike of pulpit and doorstep. But it
had all been like figures seen afar off and upon
another road. Now she had come to a place in life
where, bewildered, she found them about her. Joan
was conscious that life was becoming like an evil
dream. Just as in a dream a hundred inconsequences
might form the strongest net, entangling you, withholding
you from some longed-for escape, so now,
awake, a hundred things so little in themselves— She
never said to herself that there was a net
weaving about her; the mind, struck and bewildered,
could not yet give things a name, perhaps
would not if it could. She only saw the gold and
warmth going for her steadily out of the sunshine—and
knew not how it came that they were going
nor how to stop that departure. Now she said dully,
“I do not believe all that,” and then saw immediately
that it was a mistake for any one to say that.</p>

<p>The tinker again looked aslant. “Most of your
witches are old women. At their Sabbats you’ll see
a hundred withered gammers, dancing and leaping
around a fire with the Devil sitting in the midst, and
all sing-songing a charm and brewing in a kettle
a drink with which to freeze men’s blood! But each
crew hath always one young witch that they call the
maiden. A young and well-looking wench with red lips
and she calls the dance. They were burning
such an one where I was a while ago in Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
She cried out, ‘I be no witch! I be no witch!’ to the
end. But they sang and prayed her down and she
burned on.”</p>

<p>Joan moistened her lips. “Why did they think
she was—”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the tinker, “there was a young laird
she had bewitched! He peaked and pined and syne
he cried out that a dirk was always turning in his
side. So they found, beneath the hearth in her cot,
a figure of wax with a rusted nail set in its side, and
as the wax melted away, so was he to pine. And there
were other tokens and matters proved on her. Beside,
when they tried her in the loch she never sank
at all. <i>Convicta et combusta</i>—which is what they
write in witch cases upon the court book.”</p>

<p>By now they were much advanced upon the Hawthorn
road. The day was warm, the air moist and
languid. Joan felt deadly tired. There swam in her
mind a desire to be away, away—to find a door
from this earth that was growing drear and ugly.
She moved in silence, her grey eyes wide and fixed.
The tinker, his throat dry with talking, drew in
front of him one of the pans which he carried and
in lieu of further speech drummed upon it as he
walked. Presently a cart came up behind them,
empty but for a few trusses of hay, and the carter
known to them both, being Cecily Lukin’s brother.</p>

<p>“Hey!” said the tinker. “Give me a lift!”</p>

<p>The cart stopped. “Get in!” said Lukin. He
stared at Joan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The tinker, swinging himself up, spoke with a
grin. “There’s room for you too—”</p>

<p>Joan shook her head. She made no halting, but
went on by in her greyish gown and wide hat with
her basket on her arm.</p>

<p>The carter flicked his horse, the cart passed her,
left her behind, in a few minutes disappeared around
a bend of the road. To the last the two men stared
back at her; she seemed to hear Lukin’s slow,
clownish voice repeating Cecily’s tattle—Cecily’s
and Alison’s.</p>

<p>Hawthorn Village grew plain before her: thatched
cottages, the trees upon the green, the church yews
and the church tower—there flashed upon her
again yesterday at church, and Master Aderhold
in prison. He was a good man; despite what the
minister had said, she believed that with passion—he
was a good man. It had not kept them from
haling him to prison. What would they do to him,
what?... She came to the path that would spare
her going through the village and turned into it
from the highway. It led her by the stream and
through the fields and out upon Hawthorn Forest
road. Heron’s cottage was in sight when she met
Goodman Cole, walking to the village.</p>

<p>He looked at her oddly. “Good-day, Joan.”</p>

<p>“Good-day, Goodman.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“I walked to the castle to see Mistress Borrow.
But she was not there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Goodman Cole propped himself upon his stick,
full in her way in the sunny road. “We are seeing
strange doings in Hawthorn Parish! Aye, strange
doings we are seeing! Have you heard about Master
Harry Carthew?”</p>

<p>“No.—Heard what?”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you,” said the old man. “Yesterday
afternoon Master Carthew rode a part of the
way with the men who were taking the leech to the
town.—And there,” said Goodman Cole, “is another
strange thing! That we could like an atheist
well enough, and think him skilled and kindly, and
all the time he was mankind’s deadliest foe! ’Twas
the Devil sure that blinded us!—Well, as I was
telling you, Master Carthew rode a part of the way.
Then, having seen them well started, he turns his
horse, meaning to go first to Master Clement’s to
consult about having a commission named, before
the next assize, to look into a many things that have
happened about Hawthorn, some in connection with
the leech and some by themselves—and then to
ride from the minister’s home to Carthew House.
It was stormy as we know, the kind of hot and dark
storm they say witches brew. He was riding, looking
straight before him, and thinking what a darkness
like the darkness of the sky was over England, when
what does his horse do but start aside and begin to
rear and plunge—and yet there was nothing there!
It lightened, and the road on all sides lay bare. And
yet, in an instant, just like that! Master Carthew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
was struck in the side and wounded as by a sword
or dagger. It lightened again and he had time to see
a tall black man dressed, bit for bit, like the leech,—and
it lightened the third time and the road was
bare as a blade, only he saw on the top of a bank a
figure like a woman making signs to the sky. Then
it fell dark, and there burst a great roar of thunder
and wind and the horse began to run. He checked
it just outside Hawthorn and rode around by Old
Path and the fields, for he felt himself bleeding and
did not wish to frighten people. So, going slowly,
he got home at last, and they laid him in bed and
found a great wound in his side.... Joan!”</p>

<p>“Will he die?” said Joan.</p>

<p>“And will you be glad if he does?... Wench,
wench, why do you look like that?”</p>

<p>The old man and she faced each other, between
them but a narrow space of the forest road. Her
face was mobile, transparent,—a clear window
through which much of her nature might be read.
She had never thought to try to veil it—never
until of late. It was, on the whole, a strong and
beautiful nature, and none had quarrelled with the
face that was its window. But of late there had
come into her life to work her injury something
bitter, poisonous, and dark. Fear and hatred had
come, and a burning wrath against the net that was
weaving, she knew not how—a wrath and helplessness
and a wrath against her helplessness. All her
nature flamed against a lie and an injustice. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
because she had known so little fear, and when it
came it found it hard to make an entry, so it worked
like poison when it was within the citadel. It was
the foe she liked least; all her being rose and wrought
to cast it out. But it was giving her a fight—it
was giving her a fight.... And nowadays she had
to try not to show what she thought or felt. Sometimes,
by force of wit and will, she succeeded, keeping
her soul back from the window of her face. She
was not succeeding now, she felt. She bit her lips,
she struggled, she turned her face from Goodman
Cole, and stood, her hands closing and unclosing,
then, the victory won, but too late to save her with
him, she turned upon him a quiet face.</p>

<p>It was too late. A good old man, but simple and
superstitious, he was staring at her with a misliking
and terror of his own.</p>

<p>“I’d heard tales, but I wouldn’t believe any real
harm of Heron’s daughter,—but God knows what
to think when a woman looks like that!” He edged
from her, his hand trembled upon his staff; he
would evidently put distance between them, be gone
on his way. “The minister saith that from the
Witch of Endor on they have baleful eyes—”</p>

<p>He suddenly put himself in motion. “Good-day
to you!” he said in a quavering voice, and went on
down the road with a more rapid step than was his
wont.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">MASTER THOMAS CLEMENT</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Two</span> magistrates and certain of the clergy of the
town, Justice Carthew and Master Thomas Clement
from Hawthorn, sat in consultation in a room opening
from the hall of assizes. Court was not sitting—it
lacked a month and more of the time when
judges on circuit would appear and make a gaol delivery.
In the mean time a precognition was to be
prepared. The case was diabolical and aggravated,
involving as it did apostasy, idolatry, blasphemy,
and sorcery of a dye most villanous. Evidence
should not lack, witnesses must abound. On the
main counts of apostasy and blasphemy the prisoner
was himself convict by himself. He had been
brought from the prison hard by to this room for
examination, and the clergy had questioned him.
But no pressure or cunning questions would make
him confess idolatry or sorcery or the procuring of
Master Harry Carthew’s wound.</p>

<p>The clerk wrote down what they had—Master
Clement’s evidence and Squire Carthew’s, together
with the evidence they had gathered from others
at Hawthorn, the clergy’s questions and the prisoner’s
answers. He copied also Master Harry Carthew’s
written testimony, Master Carthew himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
being still in bed, fevered of his wound. There was
enough and many times enough for the physician’s
commitment and most close confinement until
assize day—enough to warrant what Carthew and
the clergy urged, a petition to the Privy Council
that there be especially sent a certain judge known
and belauded for his strict handling of such offences,
and that, pending assizes, a commission be named to
take depositions and make sweeping examination
throughout the Hawthorn end of the county—seeing
that Satan had rarely just one in his court.
Indeed, there were signs in many directions of a
hellish activity, whether in pact with the leech or
independent of him remained to be discovered.
Hawthorn mentioned the afflicted child at North-End
Farm, the great number of lamed animals, a
barn consumed to ashes, and the hailstorm that had
cut the young wheat.</p>

<p>“A woman was seen by Master Harry Carthew?”</p>

<p>The squire nodded. “Aye. Moreover, this long
time Mother Spuraway has been suspect.”</p>

<p>The minister of Hawthorn sat, a small, rigid,
black figure, his hands clasped upon the board before
him, his light-hued, intense eyes seeing always
one fixed vision. His voice was unexpectedly powerful,
though of a rigid quality and inclined to sing-song.
“My mind is not made up as to what brought
the plague to Hawthorn and the region north. But
I hold it full likely that Satan was concerned to
harass a godly and innocent people, godly beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
many in England, if I say it that perhaps should
not! It is well known and abundantly proved that
his imps and ministers, his infidels, Sadducees, and
witches go about to construct a pestilence no less
readily than they do a hailstorm or a tempest that
miserably sinks a ship at sea. I would have the commission
take evidence upon that point also—”</p>

<p>The clerk, a thin, stooping, humble man, slightly
coughed, then spoke deprecatingly. “If I may make
so bold, your worships—the prisoner hath a manner
of good reputation among some in this town.
He came during the plague and healed many.”</p>

<p>“Aye, so?” answered Justice Carthew. “About
Hawthorn also may be found a few silly folk who
would praise him, though none I think will praise
him who were at church last Sunday! But this cargo
of damnable stuff we’ve found will beat down their
good opinion.”</p>

<p>“The unsafest thing,” said a fellow justice, and
nodded portentously,—“the unsafest thing a plain
man can do is to think and speak well of a heretic.”</p>

<p>And with that serving-men from the Boar’s Head
near by entered, bearing a collation for the magistrates
and clergy assembled....</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the men from Hawthorn
returned home. Squire Carthew rode with pursed
lips, ponderously on to Carthew House. But the
minister refused an invitation to accompany him.
He wished to consider these matters in his closet,
alone with the Scriptures and in prayer. He put up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
his horse and went into his small, chill house. There
lived with him an aunt and one maidservant, and,
it being late, they had his supper spread and waiting.
But he would not touch the food; he had ordained
for himself a fast.</p>

<p>With a candle in his hand he went into his small
bare room and closed the door. Cloak and hat laid
aside, he appeared slight and spare and sad-coloured,
a man as intensely in earnest as might well be; a
man, as far as his conscious knowledge of himself
could light the vaults and caverns, sincere and of an
undivided will to the service and glory of his God.
On the table lay his Bible, open; from wall to wall
stretched a space of bare floor good for slow-pacing
to and fro, good for kneeling, for wrestling in prayer.
The room was haunted to him; it had seen so many
of what he and all his day, and days before and days
after, called “spiritual struggles.” But there was
pleasure no less than gloom and exaltation in the
haunting; there were emanations from the walls of
triumph, for though his soul agonized he was bold
to believe that also it conquered. He believed that
he was foe of Satan and henchman of the Lord.</p>

<p>Terror at times overwhelmed the henchman—panic
thoughts that Satan had him; cold and awful
doubts of his acceptability to his overlord. But
they were not lasting; they went away like the chill
mists from the face of the hills. It was incredible, it
was impossible that the Lord would not see his own
banner, would not recognize and succour his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
liegeman! The liegeman might err and come under
displeasure; good! the punishment came in agony
and remorse for lukewarm zeal, in a shown sight of
the evil lord to whose suzerainty he might be transferred
and of that lord’s dismal and horrible demesne!
Nay, more solemnly and threateningly, in
an allowed vision of what a disobedient liegeman
would forfeit—the heavens opening and showing
the rainbow-circled throne, the seven lamps, the sea
of glass, the winged beasts saying, “Holy, Holy,
Holy!” and giving glory and honour and thanks;
the four-and-twenty elders crowned with gold, falling
down and worshipping Him who sat on the
Throne; the streets of gold, and the twelve gates,
and the temple open in heaven, and in the temple
the ark of the testament. “O God,” prayed the
minister, “take not my name from the book of life!
Take not my name from the book of life, and I will
serve thee forever and ever!”</p>

<p>Master Clement very truly worshipped the God
whom he had seated on the throne, and was jealous
for his honour and glory and solicitous for his praise
among men, and would give life itself to bring all
mankind under his Lord’s supremacy. As little as
any man-at-war of an earthly feudal suzerain would
he have hesitated to compel them to come in. Was
it not to their endless, boundless good, and without
was there any other thing than hell eternal and everlasting
and the evil lord? If, contumaciously, they
would not come in, or if being in they rebelled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
broke from their allegiance, what else was to be
done but to carry fire and sword—that is, to put
into operation the laws of the land—against his
Lord’s enemies? Had any one called his attention
to the fact of how largely liegemen like himself had
brought these laws into being, he would have answered,
Yes; under the direction of their Suzerain’s
own Word, writ down for their perpetual guidance,
shortly after the making of the world!</p>

<p>It was not alone eager jealousy for his Lord’s
glory and honour, nor anxious care that he himself
prove in no wise an idle and unprofitable servant,
that was felt by Master Clement. To his intense
zeal and his own cries for life eternal was added a
thwart love of mankind—that portion of it enclosed
in the great sheepfold, and that portion who,
wandering outside, lost upon the mountain-sides
in the cold and darkness, yet had in them no stubbornness,
but would hasten to the fold so soon as
they heard the shepherd’s voice through the mist.
He was eager for them, his brothers and children in
the fold; eager, too, for the poor lost souls upon the
mountains,—lost, yet not wilfully, stubbornly, and
abandonedly lost, but capable of being found and regained,
so many as were elected.</p>

<p>But the others, ah, the others! they who set up
their own wills and professed other knowledge, or,
if not knowledge, then doubt and scepticism of the
liegeman’s knowledge, writing a question mark beside
that which was not to be questioned—they who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
moved away from the fold in its completeness!
Master Clement’s zeal flared downward no less than
upward, to the left no less than to the right. He
hated with intensity—with the greater intensity
that he was so sure his hatred was disinterested.
“Have I not hated <i>Thy</i> enemies?” But if those
without were manifestly rather than invisibly of the
Kingdom of Satan,—if their ill-doing was so great
that it became as it were <i>corporeal</i>,—if the people
saw them open atheists, wizards, and witches,—if
their foot had slipped or their master had been
negligent to cover them with his mantle of darkness,—the
soul of Master Clement experienced a grim
and deadly exaltation. He tightened his belt, he
saw that his axe was sharp, he went forth to hew
the dead and poisoned wood out of the forest of the
Lord.</p>

<p>In his small room he sat and read by his one
candle—read those portions of the Old Testament
and the New which he wished to read. Had a spirit
queried his choice he would have answered, “Is it
not all his Word? And are not these the indicated
circumstances and this very passage the Answer
and Direction?” When he had finished reading he
knelt and prayed long and fervently. His prayer
told his God who He was, his attributes, and what
was his usual and expected conduct; it told Him
who were his enemies and rehearsed the nature
of the ill they would do Him; then changed to
a vehement petition that if it was his will He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
would discover his enemies and bring them to confusion—and
if by means of the worm Thomas
Clement—</p>

<p>He prayed in terrible earnest, his hands locking and
unlocking, beads of sweat upon his brow, prayed
for the better part of an hour. Finally he rose from
his knees, and standing by the table read yet another
passage, then paced the floor, then sat down, and,
drawing forth the tablets upon which he had made
his own notes of the examination that day, fell to
studying them, the open book yet beside him.</p>

<p>He read over a list of questions with the answers
Aderhold had given. He had not been quick to give
the answers—he had fenced—he had striven to shift
the ground—but at last, with a desperate quietness,
he had given them.</p>

<p><i>Qu.</i> Do you believe in God?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> In my sense, yes. In your sense, no.</p>

<p><i>Qu.</i> In God as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Qu.</i> Then you do not believe in the Trinity?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> No.</p>

<p>There were other questions—a number of them—and
the answers. But the very beginning was
enough—enough. Master Clement, sitting rigidly,
stared at the opposite wall. A sentence formed itself
clearly before his eyes, the letters well made, of a
red colour. Only the last of the three words wavered
a little. CONVICTED AND HANGED. Or
it might be CONVICTED AND BURNED. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
first two words stood steady, and above them the
name, GILBERT ADERHOLD.</p>

<p>The concern was now to prove the sorcery—and
to take all confederates in the net—to lop Satan
in all his members.</p>

<p>The minister stared at the wall. Another name
formed itself as though it were stained there—MOTHER
SPURAWAY....</p>

<p>Master Clement sat rigid, trying to place other
names beside this one. It was his sincere belief that
there were others. The probable diabolical activities
at the Oak Grange—the coming to Hawthorn, after
so long and godly an immunity, of the late sickness—the
varied and mysterious happenings, losses, and
attacks with which village and countryside were
beginning to buzz—this final heinous Satan-revenge
and attempt upon the godliest and most greatly
promising young man of whom he had any knowledge—back
again, and above all, to the blasphemer,
the atheist, the idolater, and denier now fast in
gaol!—Master Clement was firm in his belief that
so frightful and important a round of occurrences
pointed to many and prime agents of evil, though
always that unbeliever yonder would prove the ring-leader,
the very lieutenant of Satan himself! Hawthorn
made a narrow stage for such a determined
and concentrated presence and effort on the part of
the Prince of the Power of the Air. But Master
Clement’s was a narrow experience and a mind of
one province. To him, truly, the stage seemed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the widest, and the quarry worthy Apollyon’s presence
in person.</p>

<p>The atheist and sorcerer himself—Mother Spuraway—who
else? The minister thought of old
Dorothy at the Grange. There existed a presupposition
of contamination. On the other hand, so
far as he knew, there had never gone out a word
against her; she had seemed a pious, harmless soul,
trudging to church in all weathers. That in itself,
though, the Devil was wont to use as a mask.
Witness the atheist and sorcerer at church! Nay,
was it not known that sometimes Satan came himself
to listen and to confound, if he might, the
preacher, making him tame and cold in his discourse;
or razing from his memory that which he
had carefully prepared; or putting into his mind,
even while he preached, worldly and wicked and
satiric thoughts; or during a sermon of so great
power that all who heard should be lifted to the
courts of heaven, stuffing the mind of the congregation
with a like gallimaufrey?</p>

<p>The minister sat stiffly, staring at the wall. Dorothy’s
name did not form itself there before him, but
neither did he wholly dismiss it from mind. He put
it, as it were, on the wall at right angles, marked,
“To be further thought on.” Then what other name
or names for the main wall?... Old Marget Primrose
was dead. He thought of two or three old
and solitary women, and of the son of one of the
Grange tenants—a silent and company-shunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
youth who had gotten his letters somehow, and went
dreaming through the woods with a book. Once
Master Clement, meeting him by the stream-side,
had taken his book from him and looking at it found
it naught but idle verse; moreover, it seemed that
it was Master Gilbert Aderhold’s book, and that
the youth went at times to the Grange for instruction....
All these, the boy with the itch for learning,
and the two or three women he relegated to the
wall with old Dorothy.</p>

<p>There was one other—there was Grace Maybank.
She was not old, but Satan, though for occult
reasons he oftenest signed them old, signed them
young as well, and though he gave preferment to
the ugly and the bent, would take good looks when
they were at hand. Satan had already signed Grace
in another department of the Kingdom of Evil-doing.
The minister rose, and going to a press that stood
in the room, took from it a book in which was entered,
among other things, cases of church discipline.
He found the page, the date several years back.
<i>Grace Maybank, Fornicatress. Stood before the congregation,
two Sundays in each month for three months
in succession. Texts preached from on these Sundays,
for the warning of sinners....</i> And again, <i>Grace
Maybank, her infant being born, stood with it in her
arms before the congregation, Sunday, June the ——</i>.</p>

<p>Grace came into the probable class. Moreover—“Ha!”
said the minister, recollection rising to the
surface. He took from a second shelf a book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
record, made not by himself, but by his predecessor,
the godly Master Thomson. It ran back twenty
years and more. He found near the beginning of
the book what he was looking for. <i>Ellice Maybank.
Suspect of being a witch, and dragged through Hawthorn
Pond. The said Ellice swam. Died of a fever
before she could be brought to trial.</i></p>

<p>“Ha!” said Master Clement; “it descends! it descends!”
But he was a careful and scrupulous man,
and so he put Grace’s name only up on the probable
wall.</p>

<p>It was growing late. A wind had arisen and
moaned around the house. He went to the window
and looked out at the church and the church yews.
A waning moon hung in the east. The yews were
black, the church was palely silvered; Master
Clement regarded the church with eyes that softened,
grew almost mild. The plain interior, the
plain exterior, the hard stones, the tower lifting
squarely and uncompromisingly toward the span
of sky that was called the zenith—whatever of
romance was in Master Clement’s nature clung and
centred itself here! Hawthorn Church was his beloved,
it was his bride.</p>

<p>He stood by the window for some minutes, then
turning began again to pace the room, and then once
more to read in the Bible. It chanced now—his
main readings that night having been concluded—that
he had eyes for passages of a different timbre.
He read words of old, firm wisdom, Oriental tenderness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
mystic rapture, strainings toward unity—golden
words that time would not willingly let slip.
Many a soul, many a tradition, many a mind had
left their mark in that book, and some were very
beautiful, and the voices of some were music and
long-lasting truth and carried like trumpets.</p>

<p>Master Clement read, and his soul mounted: only
it mounted not to where it could overlook the earlier
reading in the same Bible. It never came to a point
where it could hold the two side by side and say,
“Judge you which concept and which mind you will
accept as brother to your own! For many minds
have made this book.” Master Clement read, and
his soul lightened and lifted, but not so far as to
change settled perspectives. Had he not read these
passages a thousand times before? The names remained
upon the wall, and when after a time he
undressed and laid himself in bed, they stayed before
him without a shadow of wavering until he
slept. Indeed, he drowsed away upon the word
CONVICTED—</p>

<p>Morning came. He rose at an ascetic’s hour,
dressed in a half-light, and ate his frugal breakfast
while the day was yet at the dawn. The two women
waited upon him; breakfast over, he read the Scriptures
to them, and standing, prayed above their
bowed heads. Later he went out into the hedged
path between his house and the church and began
his customary slow walking to and fro for morning
exercise. The sun was coming up, a multitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
birds sang in the ancient trees. Master Clement
walked, small, arid, meagre, and upright, his hands
at his sides, and presently, in his walking, caught
sight of something white at the edge of the path. It
proved to be a hand’s-breadth of paper, kept in
place by a pebble. He stooped and picked it up. On
it was marked in rude letters, JOAN HERON. He
turned it over—nothing on the other side, blank
paper save for the name. He walked on with it in
his hand. Twenty paces farther there was another
piece of paper, held by another pebble, and a fair duplicate
of the first—JOAN HERON. Well within
the churchyard he found the third piece—JOAN
HERON. ASK JOAN HERON WHO GAVE
HER THE RUE THAT’S PLANTED IN HER
GARDEN.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">MOTHER SPURAWAY</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Master Clement</span>, the papers in his hand, retraced
his steps until he came to a bench set in the shadow
of a yew that knotted the minister’s house and garden
to the churchyard. He sat down and spread the
three out upon the wood beside him. It was the last-found
scrap upon which, naturally, he concentrated
attention. ASK JOAN HERON WHO GAVE HER
THE RUE THAT’S PLANTED IN HER GARDEN.
He sat with knitted brow and pursed lips,
searching for a meaning. One was not there at first
sight. He weighed the words. JOAN HERON—The
daughter of old Heron that had died of the
plague. He brought her before his mind’s eye—a
tall, grey-eyed girl sitting quietly in church. Save
for that image she did not come into his mind with
any force; he had, after all, no great knowledge of
her. They were outlying people, the Herons, and
then they had been away from Hawthorn. He was a
man of the study and the pulpit and of crisises in
the parish, rather than of any minute, loving, daily
intercourse and knowledge; theologian rather than
pastor. JOAN HERON. He would, however,
presently think together any impressions or memories.
Now little occurred further than that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
had been away with her father for years, living
under the walls of the castle that was prelatical.
In addition, he remembered that neither old Roger
Heron nor this girl had ever brought to him spiritual
problems to be solved. Many did bring them—cold,
creeping doubts as to whether God really meant to
save them or not. But the Herons had never done
so. The fact, called to mind, just faintly darkened
for him the name beneath his hand. He would
make enquiries.—WHO GAVE HER THE RUE
THAT’S PLANTED IN HER GARDEN.</p>

<p>Master Clement frowned. He had little taste for
riddles and uncertainties and haunting suspensions
of thought. Make a line distinct; colour matters
plainly; if a thing were black, paint it in black! The
words on the paper carried no meaning, or a foolish
one. RUE.... Not long before he had been reading
an account, set forth in a book, of a number of
Satan’s machinations, and of the devices, likings,
and small personal habits of his sworn servants. A
bit of this text suddenly sprang out before him, sitting
there beneath the yew tree. “<i>For plants—hemlock,
poppy, and mandrake, and, especially, the
witches love, handle, and give to such as show inclination
to become of their company, rue</i>—”</p>

<p>Master Clement slowly folded the three pieces of
paper together, took out his pocketbook, and laid
them in it. Grace Maybank was yet strongly in his
mind, but now on the wall beside her name he put
another name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later, hatted and cloaked, he stepped into
Hawthorn street. As he did so he looked northward
and, seeing Squire Carthew riding in from
Carthew House, stood and waited. The squire approached,
gave good-morning, and dismounted. He
nodded his head; ponderously energetic he had put
already his engines into motion. The constable with
helpers was gone at sunrise to take into custody
Mother Spuraway, have her into the village, and
thrust her into the room beneath the sexton’s house
that did for village gaol. To-morrow, after examination,
and if proof of her evil-doing were forthcoming,
she should be sent to town and quartered in the
prison with the leech. Orders likewise had been given
to the North-End Farm folk to bring into Hawthorn
the afflicted boy. To confront the injurer with the
injured, that was the best and approved way—</p>

<p>“How is Harry Carthew this morning?”</p>

<p>“Very fevered still. He talks strangely and paganly—about
gods and goddesses and Love and
the Furies and I know not what trash.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Master Clement. “Were it devil or
Gilbert Aderhold who struck him that night, be sure
from the dagger would have run Satan’s own venom,
empoisoning the mind, bringing growth of nettles
and darnel into the soul! The godly young man! I
will pray—I will wrestle with God in prayer for
Harry Carthew—”</p>

<p>From beyond the church there burst a small riot of
sound. “They’ve got Mother Spuraway—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The constable had his hand upon the old woman’s
arm and dragged her along, she being lame and
stumbling. Behind them marched the constable’s
helpers, a self-constituted posse. Here was the
father of the afflicted boy, and Lukin the carter, and
a ditcher whose arm was palsied, and one or two
others. A dozen boys brought up the rear. One had
run ahead to cry to the village what was happening.
Everybody was coming to door and window, out of
doors, into the street. Voices buzzed and clacked.
The witch fever was mounting, mounting, hardening
the heart, confusing the head!</p>

<p>When Mother Spuraway saw the minister and the
squire, for all she was as old and spare and feeble as a
dried reed, she broke from the constable, and, running
to them, fell upon her knees and raising her
clasped hands began at once to protest her innocence
and to beg for mercy.</p>

<p>The squire spoke to the North End farmer.
“They’re bringing your son in?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir. His mother and sister and my son
that’s married and his wife and my niece and Humphrey
Tanner. He’s twisting fearful, and he sees the
dog come day and come night!”</p>

<p>“Your worship, your worship!” cried the old woman
on her knees. “I never could abide dogs—Is it
likely I’d trouble a child?—Oh, Master Clement—”</p>

<p>The squire was speaking with the constable and
the farmer, the whole company of witch-takers
hearkening to him rather than to Mother Spuraway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Had she not kept up a like babble clean from her
own hut to Hawthorn? But the witch and straightening
out the two walls were Master Clement’s concern.
Not always subtle, he was subtle when it came
to playing the inquisitor. When the rôle fell to him, it
was as though he had suddenly endued himself with
a mantle that fitted. Had he lived in a Catholic
country, had he been born and baptized there into an
unquerying group, it is not unlikely that sooner or
later he would have found employment in the Holy
Office, unlikelier yet that he would not have served
with zeal and a consciousness of high devoir done
that King in heaven. In a vast range of relations
starkly literal, he was capable when it came to theological
detection, of keen and imaginative work.
The churchyard yews somewhat cut off the village
street; the small present crowd were attending to
the squire. Master Clement put some questions.
Mother Spuraway, who was now moaning and rocking
herself, roused as best she could to answer.
Associates? She had no associates. What, in God’s
name, should she have associates for? The leech?
Well, the leech had taken her trade, that was all the
association there—</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Master Clement. “The same trade!
She hath said that far!”</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway looked at him and shrank affrighted.
“My trade was to gather good herbs and
make sick folk well. I meant that I was a leech as
well as he.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Leechcraft is not for women,” answered Master
Clement. “But leechcraft was not his main trade.
His trade is in souls to Satan, his own soul and
others. I fear me that thou art indentured to that
same master and may well speak of this atheist and
sorcerer as thy fellow trafficker! Tell me what others
thou art concerned with—”</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway had an inward sturdiness,
though age and weakness, fear and pain might yet
betray it. “Concerned neither with him nor with
others. Oh me! oh me! I’ve always stood on my
own feet and harmed no one—”</p>

<p>“They that stand on their own feet and by their
own strength,” said the minister, “are naught. So
they lean not upon Scripture and know that they
are naught in themselves, but only by grace of another,
they are already lost and have reached their
hand to Satan.—Tell me if Grace Maybank be of
thy company?”</p>

<p>“Grace Maybank!” Mother Spuraway’s voice
quavered and her frame seemed to shake. Perhaps
there rose a memory of a love philtre or charm, or of
Grace in trouble, coming secretly for counsel. But
Mother Spuraway never took life. The child was
born, was it not?—as merry and pretty a child as if
it were not set apart and branded for life. Grace?
It had been little that she had done for Grace! The
charm had not worked; the man would not offer
marriage, and so save Grace from what came upon
her. Grace herself had come to the hut and bitterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
reviled her for a useless wise woman. Grace Maybank!
She began to stammer and protest that she
and Grace were strangers.—But Master Clement
thought the most and the worst and the impossible.
“Ha!” he said. “That window hath a light in it!”
In his mind Grace’s name left the one wall and came
over to the other.</p>

<p>The squire made a movement from the constable,
the constable a movement toward his prisoner.
“Tell me,” said Master Clement in a tense and low
voice,—“tell me why you gave a bush of rue to
Joan Heron?”</p>

<p>He had not known that she had done it. It had
flashed upon him to make that move. Made, he saw
that it was correct.</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway, dazed and shaken, put up her
two hands as though to ward off blows that she
knew not why were coming. “What harm,” queried
her thin old frightened voice, “in giving a body a
sprig of rue? She had none in her garden.”</p>

<p>“How did the rue come to you?”</p>

<p>“It was growing about the burned cot.” For all
her terror and misery Mother Spuraway felt a gust
of anger. “O Jesus! What questions Master Clement
asks!”</p>

<p>The constable came and took her by the arms.
“On with you! Don’t say that you can’t walk, when
we know that you can dance and fly!”</p>

<p>She broke again into a pitiful clamour. “I am no
witch!—Satan’s no friend nor master nor king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of mine—I know naught of the leech—I’ve put
no spell on any one—Oh, gentlemen, gentlemen,
think on the mother that bore you—” The constable
and his helpers dragged her away. Her voice
came back—“Think—think! How could I—”</p>

<p>In a little while the North-End Farm folk came
into Hawthorn—Hawthorn quivering now with excitement.
Every loss of a twelvemonth, every undeserved
grief, every untoward happening, every
petty mystery was awake and growing monstrous.
The air was changing, the yew trees, the look of the
houses, the loom to the west of Hawthorn Forest....
To-day, to an observer, the church might look
not greatly different from a palm-thatched or cedar
roof over some sacred stone or carven god. Out of
the deep veins, out of the elder world, old and gross
superstition had been whistled up. It had not far
to come; the elder world was close of kin. On the
climbing road of the human mind the scenery of the
lower slopes began to glow.</p>

<p>The sexton’s house giving upon the green, Hawthorn
could find pretext enough for gathering there
in humming clusters. The sexton had a clean, bare
room where at times charges were heard and prisoners
brought up for examination from a cellar-like
apartment below. On the whole, Justice Carthew
preferred it to having poachers and vagrants, quarrelers,
swearers and breakers of various commandments,
petty officers, complainants, and witnesses
trampling into Carthew House. Now as the warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
midday drew on, he entered, marshalled by the constable;
with him, besides a young man half his son’s
tutor, half his own clerk, Master Clement, and a
neighbour or two of fair consequence in the village
and in Hawthorn Church. In the room already
were the North-End Farm folk. The crowd pressed
in behind, or, when no more were admitted, stood
as close as might be without the door, left open for
the air. Outside the one crazy window boys stood
on heaped stones, their eyes a-row above the sill.
The air seemed to beat and sound and pulse. No
other kind of lawbreaking could so raise, so universalize,
emotion. Other kinds were particular, affecting
a few. But where sorcery and witchcraft, blasphemy
and heresy, were arraigned, even though it
were in a poor room and village like to this, there
the universal enemy, there the personal foe of God
Almighty, came into court! The personal foe of
God was naturally the would-be murderer of every
baptized soul alive—the unbaptized were his already.
Nor did he stop at attempts against their
souls; he did not hesitate to direct his engines
against their bodies and their goods, to burn their
ricks and barns, blast their fields, palsy their arms,
lame their beasts, make their children peak and
pine, wither the strength of men within them—If
he had not yet harmed them to-day, he but waited
for the chance to do so to-morrow! No man, woman,
or child was safe, and the thing to be done was to destroy
his instruments as fast as they were found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The North-End Farm boy—an observer from the
platform of a further age might have conjectured
that it was partly a nervous disorder marked by
hysteria, partly an impish satisfaction in the commotion
produced and the attention received, partly
an actual rejoicing in the workings of his own imagination
together with a far past, early-man unawareness
of any reason for forbearance—the North-End
Farm boy cried out and writhed tormentedly.</p>

<p>They brought Mother Spuraway up the steep
stair from the cellar and into the room, and making
a clear space stood her before the boy for what
should be judgement and doom. “The dog! the
dog!” he cried, and writhed in the arms of the men
behind him—“The dog!”</p>

<p>The room quivered and sucked in its breath.
Now the magistrate, and now, at the magistrate’s
nod, the minister, questioned him. “You see the
dog?—Where do you see it?—There? But something
else is standing there! A woman is standing
there.... Ha! Only the dog there, showing his
teeth at you? Do you see no woman?... He sees
no woman. He sees only the dog.”</p>

<p>“The dog! the dog!” cried the boy. “The constable
brought the dog in with him.... Oh, it
wants to get at me! It’s trying to shake the constable
off! Oh, oh, don’t let it!” And he writhed
and twisted, half terrified and persuaded by the
vividness of his own creation, deep down enjoying
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Commotion and hard breathing held in the room
and outside about the door and window. “He sees
her as she is when she’s running with Satan!...
Witch!... Witch!...”</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway fell again upon her knees, beat
her hands together with passion. “It’s not true—he’s
lying!—Oh, sirs, are you going to hang me
for what a sick child says?”</p>

<p>North-End Farm raised an answering clamour.
“Thou witch! ’Tis thou that liest! Take thy spells
off him!” The greater part of the room became
vocal, “’Tis not only that boy!—A many and a
many things happening!—My arm, thou witch! I
dug all day, and passed thee in the twilight, and
next day ’twas like this!—The corn so thin and
burned!—The old witch! She made a sign above
my wife’s drink and she died and the babe died!—The
witch! the witch! But she’s not alone....
She and the leech.... Yes, but others than the
leech.... There are folk here who can tell....
The plague—she brought the plague—she and
the Devil and her fellows.... The pond!—Tie her
thumb and toe and try her in the water—”</p>

<p>There came a surge forward. Mother Spuraway
cowered and screamed. The squire might not object
to the water trial in itself, but he objected and that
strongly to any unruliness before Justice Carthew.
The people were used to being cowed; his voice,
bursting out against them, drove them back to a
silence broken only by murmurs and intakes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
breath. The North-End Farm boy continuing
noisy, and crying out, his father and mother had
leave to take him from the sexton’s room and across
to the ale-house. There was curiosity to see if the
dog that was visible to him alone could follow. But
no! At the door he cried out that it tried to spring
after him, but could not pass the minister’s chair.
From the ale-house itself presently came back word
that he was much comforted and quiet and said that
Master Clement was keeping the dog from him.</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway sat on a bench, somewhat cut
off from the rest of the room by the heavy chairs of
the Law and the Church. She sat crouched together,
for the most part silent, her white hair straggling
from beneath her cap, her lip fallen, her meagre,
bloodless hands with high-raised veins plucking at
the stuff of her old worn kirtle. The day was warm.
The squire, heated and thirsty, sent across for a
tankard of ale. When it was brought, he drank, set
the vessel down, and wiped his mouth. “And now,”
he said, “‘tis to find if, in getting two, we get all the
vipers in the nest—”</p>

<p>He did not think so himself; nor did Master
Clement, nor did the throng of Hawthorn in the
sexton’s room and without, pressing about door and
window. The whispers had been continuous. It was
much to have put an arresting hand upon one witch,
and beyond doubt she was a witch and a <i>vera causa</i>!
But for more years than a few Hawthorn had looked
somewhat askance at Mother Spuraway. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
been among them for a long time, and these blackest
happenings had not happened. Not in all these
years the plague—never before at Hawthorn such a
thing as the bold wounding of the squire’s brother—never
before so many accidents of one kind and another!
For new activities new beings.... The leech,
of course, proved beyond all seeming to be so fell
and wicked a man! But not the leech alone....
The feeling, whatever it was, was increasing. There
seemed something pent and thunderous, lying in
wait for its chance.... There were those now in the
crowd who had not been here earlier, who, having
heard what was toward, had made their way in
after the first. Some came from without the village.
The tinker was plain to the front. Midway of the
room might be seen Will the smith’s son and his
mother, and beside them Katherine Scott, the forester’s
wife. At the back, in company with the
Lukins, stood Alison Inch.</p>

<p>The squire looked down at a piece of paper which
he held in his hand. “Now what is this about a
grey and white cat, and the burned cot in Hawthorn
Wood?”</p>

<p>There rose a murmur, like wind over sedge. It
grew in volume, and out of it came clear a woman’s
voice. “It’s her familiar. He gave it to her. The
boys saw him give it to her at the burned cot.”</p>

<p>The squire lifted himself a little—looked over
the crowd. “Who spoke there? Come forward here,
you who spoke!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>A confusion; then Cecily Lukin was pushed to the
front. She came protesting, her face flushed. “Oh,
Your Honour, I didn’t know I was speaking so
loud! I never meant to say anything—”</p>

<p>“Nay, you <i>must</i> say,” answered the squire. “He
or she who keeps witness back will find trouble for
their own part!”</p>

<p>“I said naught,” said Cecily, “but that she had
a grey and white cat which lay on the hearth or in
the sun, and that once I did see it anger itself and
grow larger than natural, and its eyes glowed like lanthorns
and it went backward, rubbing itself against
her skirt—”</p>

<p>“Mother Spuraway’s skirt?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir!” said Cecily. “They say Mother
Spuraway’s imp is a green frog that lives in a stream
by her door—”</p>

<p>A boy beside the tinker, nudged by the latter,
opened his mouth. “Tom and Dick and Jarvis and I
were playing in Hawthorn Forest by the burned cot.
And a grey and white cat came out of the stones and
climbed up in the plum tree and sat and looked at
us, and we tried to drive it away, but we couldn’t.
Then Master Aderhold came out of the woods and
grew as tall as the plum tree and put up his arm, and
the cat came and lay upon it. And there was Joan
Heron standing in her grey dress, and she was as tall
as he was, and he gave her the cat and she laid it
along her shoulder, and they went away through the
woods without their feet touching the ground—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The forester’s wife was an impatient dame. By
this she had worked her way into the row nearest the
justice and the minister, and now she raised her
voice. “Your Honour and Maister Clement, I keep
bees, and, Your Honour, they’ve not done well for
a lang, lang time! They’ve not done well since, out
of kindness, I took three hives frae folk that were
gaeing visiting and put them with my ain. Those
bees I took, I swear were not just bees! Times I
thought as much while they harboured with my
bees, and would do naught nor let my ain do aught—but
I kenned it well when they were gone back
to where they came frae! Your Honour and Maister
Clement, I ha’ gone by where those hives stand
now and seen those bees come flying in with wings a
span long and shining, and bodies daubed with gold
and making a humming sound like a fiddle-string!
And those visiting folk were not auld Mither Spuraway,
though I doubt not she be a witch, too!—Those
beehives are standing under the thatch of Heron’s
cottage!”</p>

<p class="p2">At sunset that evening Joan sat on her doorstep,
her elbows upon her knees and her brow in her
hands. The apple trees were in bloom, the heartsease
was in bloom beside the well, red and gold cowslips
brushed her shoe. The day had been warm, but
the evening fell cool and rich. All day she had not
gone from the cottage. She had seen none pass
either; the road, the fields, the wood were as quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
as though human life had fled from the earth. She
sat with a heart oppressed, the world grown vague
and monstrous.... The cottage, the garden, the
fruit trees were wrapped in the afterglow. The birds
were still; the last bee had come in from the flowers;
somewhere in a marshy meadow, the frogs were beginning.</p>

<p>The grey and white cat came and rubbed itself
against her. She lifted her head, and saw three or
four men on the winding path between the forest
road and Heron’s cottage. As they came nearer she
recognized first the tinker, but in a moment saw
that the one at the head was the Hawthorn constable.
Her heart stopped, then began to beat very
heavily. As they came through the gate and up
the little path she rose from the doorstep.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” said one of them.</p>

<p>“Good-day, neighbours.”</p>

<p>The constable cleared his throat. He was a stolid,
elderly man with many daughters and sons, and he
opposed to the world a wooden, depthless face.
“Probably you know,” he said, “what we’ve come
for?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Joan: “what have you come for?”</p>

<p>The constable put out the staff that he carried and
touched her on the shoulder. “In the King’s name!
You’re to come with me for being a witch and working
great harm to the King’s good subjects—for
laming and casting spells—for worshipping Satan
at his sabbats at the burned cot and the fairy oak—for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
plotting mischief with an infidel, blasphemer, and
sorcerer—”</p>

<p>Joan stood motionless, her grey eyes clear, the
blood not driven from her heart. She had seen the
harm brewing, she had had her torture in watching
the deep storm gather; now that it was rolling over
her she grew suddenly steady. Though she knew it
not she had always had strength and courage, but
now she touched and drew from some great reservoir
indeed. A wholesome anger helped her to it, an inner
total rebellion and scorn, an amazed recognition of
universal, incredible mistake and folly! Truly if men
based life so crumblingly, on such a lie as this!...
Sabbats at the burned cot and the fairy oak....
Plotting with— Something swept over her face, her
frame seemed to grow taller in the flower-starred
dusk by Heron’s cottage.</p>

<p>The tinker was next to the constable. Now he
spoke with an elfish grin and his foot trampling
down the cowslip by the door. “Mistress Young
Witch never thought, did she, that when Tom Tinker
came up behind her, standing before the prison
yonder, he saw well enough that she was making
witch signs to one within?—Now the witch to the
warlock—lemans must lodge under the same roof!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GAOL</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Aderhold</span> looked forth from a narrow grating, so
high-placed that he must stand a-tiptoe like a child
to see at all. Summer without,—summer, summer,
and the winds of heaven! Within the gaol was summer
close and stagnant. It was difficult for light and
air to make their way into the space where he was
kept. What could come came, but much was prevented
by the walls and the intention with which
they had been built. In that day, in a prison such as
this, a noisy medley of people without freedom
might be found in the dark and damp central passage
and larger rooms or in the high-walled and dismal
bit of court. All manner of crime and no-crime,
soil, mistake, and innocence huddled there together,
poisoning and being poisoned. Time and space
received of their poison, carried it without these
walls with at least as much ease as air and light came
in, and distributed it with a blind face and an impartial
hand.</p>

<p>But certain prisoners, those that people without
the prison thought too poisonous or were willing
vengefully to make suffer, were not allowed the hallway
or the court or speech with fellow misery. These
were put into small, twilight chambers or dungeons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Aderhold paced twelve feet by six—twelve feet
by six. He was shackled, a chain from ankle to
ankle, another from wrist to wrist. But they were
not heavy, and there was slack enough, so that one
might walk and to some extent use the hands.
Twelve feet by six—twelve feet by six. What
light fell through the loophole window fell in one
thin shaft of gold-dust. The walls were damp to the
touch, and scratched over with names, ribaldry, and
prayers. He himself, with a bit of pointed stone
that he had found, was graving in Latin upon an
unmarked breadth. Twelve by six—twelve by six—where
the straw pallet was flung, not more than
three feet clear.</p>

<p>He knew well how to avail himself of the escape
of the mind and thereby to defeat the hours. He
had no books, but memory and imagination were
to him landscape and library, while the searching
thought worked here as elsewhere. Memory and
imagination could become his foes; Aderhold had
known that from of old. Oftenest friends and great
genii, but sometimes foes with mowing faces and
stabbing, icy fingers. But strangely to him, in
these days, no hostile side appeared; or if it came,
it came in lessened strength; or if its strength was
the same, then the opposing forces within him had
themselves gathered power to overcome. It seemed
to him that of late he had come to a turning; fear,
shrinking, and dismay, that had often met him full
course in life, often lurked for him at corners he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
must pass, seemed now themselves somewhat
shrunken and sinewless. He had known that there
was further growth within him—oh, further,
further!—and that some day he would turn and
look them in the face and see them for the pygmies
that they were. It seemed that the dawn of that
day had been nearer than he knew.... Twelve
feet by six—twelve feet by six—with as even and
steady a pace as the irons would allow, and all the
time to fancy that he walked free in Hawthorn
Wood. Then, for a change, to draw himself up and
see what might be seen through the slit of window.
What might be seen was the topmost branch of a
tree and a gargoyled angle of the great church
tower, and above all a scimitar breadth of blue sky.
From that to turn and grave at a letter upon the
wall; then to walk again; then to rest upon the
straw while the subtile body went free, passed like
an emanation through the prison walls and wandered
in foreign lands, and where there was neither
land nor water underfoot. At times he took under
consideration his own present predicament and
earthly future. But the sting and terror were gone.
That they were so he thanked his higher self, his
widening, deepening, marching consciousness.</p>

<p>His present case.... There had been the examination
immediately after his arrest and commitment
to this gaol, the examination when he had
admitted the apostasy and denied the sorcery. But
that had been weeks ago, and since then naught.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Day after day in this dusk place, and only the
turnkey had entered.</p>

<p>This gaoler was a battered, sometime soldier, red-faced
and wry-mouthed. What romance had been
in his life appeared to have come to him with the
dykes and green levels and waters of the Low Countries.
Chance leading him one day to the discovery
that his prisoner knew Zutphen, Utrecht, and Amsterdam,
he had henceforth, at each visit, plunged
back for one short moment into the good old wars
and renewed a lurid happiness. The reflex, striking
upon Aderhold, lightened his lot as prisoner. The
gaoler, after the first few days, exhibited toward him
no personal brutality. Once he made, unexpectedly,
the remark that he had seen good fighting done by
all manner of people, and that the Devil must have
some virtue in order to make so good a stand. But
the gaoler’s visits were of the briefest, and he was
close-mouthed as to all things save the wars. If he
knew when assizes would be, he chose not to impart
it. One day only he had been communicative enough
to speak of the commission named by the Privy
Council. Who were the commissioners? He named
the members from this side of the county—two or
three of the clergy, several considerable country
gentlemen. From the Hawthorn end Squire Carthew
and his brother and Master Clement the minister.
It had been at work, the commission, meeting
and meeting and taking people up. The matter was
become a big matter, making a noise through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
country. They said the King himself was interested.
A bishop was coming—and the Witch Judge.</p>

<p>“The Witch Judge?”</p>

<p>“Aye, the Witch Judge.”</p>

<p>But the gaoler would say no more—Aderhold
was not sure that he knew much more. He left the
cell, and at no other visit would he speak of anything
but the Dutch and the good wars.... What
he had said had left a sharp thorn of anxiety,—not
for the prisoner’s self. Aderhold knew perfectly
well how palely hope gleamed upon Gilbert Aderhold.
He would be done to death. But he knew also,
from much observation, how they dragged the net
so as to take in unallied forms. He tried to think of
any at Hawthorn or thereabouts who might be endangered.
He had been intimate with no one; none
there had been confidant or disciple. How many
that could save he had had occasion to note in
France and Italy. Speech with such an one, acts of
mere neighbourliness, the sheerest accidental crossing
of paths—anything served for prosecution
and ruin.... In the lack of all knowledge he was
chiefly anxious about old Dorothy and the boy her
nephew, and the youth to whom he had given
books. He never thought of Joan as being in peril.</p>

<p>Counting the days, he gathered that assizes could
now be no great way off. Then would he hear and
know, be judged and suffer. After that—continuance,
persistence, being, yet and for ever, though he
knew not the mode nor the manner of experience....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
The gold light lay across the cell like a fairy road.
He turned upon his side, eased wrist and ankle as
best he might, and with the chain across his breast
fell half asleep. Ocean waves seemed to bear him up,
a strong warm wind to blow upon him, birds to
be flying toward him from some beautiful, friendly
strand....</p>

<p>The grating of the key roused him. It was not
the gaoler’s time of day, but he was here, red-faced
and wry-mouthed.</p>

<p>Aderhold rose to his feet. “Are the Judges
come?”</p>

<p>The gaoler shook his head. “No, no! They’re
trying highway thieves next county. You’re to be
lodged t’other side of gaol.”</p>

<p>They went down a winding stair and through a
dark and foul passageway, then from one general
room to another. The place was here dusk and
gloom, here patched with sunny light. It was well
peopled with shapes despairing and complaining,
or still and listless, or careless and noisy. The
gaoler and Aderhold crossed a bit of court and came
by a small door into a long and narrow room where
again there were prisoners, men and women.</p>

<p>“Stand here,” said the gaoler, “while I get an
order.” He moved away to a door in the wall.</p>

<p>The place was warm and dusk, save where from
high windows there fell a broken and wavering light.
There was a dull murmur as of droning bees. Sound,
too, from the town square without floated in,—summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
sounds. A fugitive memory came to Aderhold.
It was years ago, and a spring morning, and
he was riding across the square with Will the serving-man,
Master Hardwick behind in the litter,
ahead on his great roan Harry Carthew. Upon the
heels of that retracing came another. It was last
winter again, and he stood on a doorstep not far
from here, and ten feet away Sir Richard from the
castle sat his horse and smelled at his silver box of
spices.... He came back to the present hour. This
place was long, like a corridor; it was curiously gold-brown
and red-brown, like a rich painting for light
and shadow. He looked across and, standing alone
against the wall, he saw Joan Heron.... All noise
stilled itself, all other shapes passed. It was as
though there were spread around them the loneliest
desert or sea-strand in all the world.</p>

<p>Joan stood straight against the wall. Her grey
dress was torn, her grey eyes had shadows beneath
them, she had no colour in cheek or lip, and she
stood indomitable.</p>

<p>Aderhold put his hand before his eyes. “Mistress
Friendly Soul,” he said, “why are you here?”</p>

<p>“For somewhat the same reason,” she answered,
“that you are here. Because it is a crazed world.”</p>

<p>“How long—?”</p>

<p>“A long time.... Nearly four weeks.”</p>

<p>“Is it my misery to have brought you here?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Joan, “cruelty and wrong brought me
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are charged with—”</p>

<p>“Yes. With witchcraft.”</p>

<p>The gaoler, returning, began furiously to grumble
that he would have no speaking together, and urged
Aderhold away. There was naught to do but to
obey; he went, but at the door looked back. She
was standing with her grey eyes and her sorrowful
face set in scorn of this place and of the world. The
door closed between them.</p>

<p>“No!” said the gaoler. “No questions, for I’ll
not answer them. Say naught and pay naught!—Down
this stair. You won’t be so well lodged.”</p>

<p>It mattered not greatly to Gilbert Aderhold how
he was lodged. When the gaoler was gone and the
grating key removed, and solitude with him in this
dim place, he lay down upon the stone that made its
flooring and hid his face. After a time, rising, he
walked the dungeon where he was immured. He
struck his shackled hands against the wall, pressed
his forehead against the stone....</p>

<p>The hours passed, the day passed, another night
passed; another dawn came, strengthening outside
into burning day. The gaoler appeared for a moment
morning and evening, then darkness and silence....
He thought that he must be yet nearer the great
church than he had been in his first cell. He could
hear the bells, and they clanged more loudly here.</p>

<p>Aderhold, pacing the space not much longer or
wider than a grave, heard in their ringing church
bells far and near and deep in time. He heard them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
ringing over Europe and from century to century.
He heard the bells of a countryside that had rung
when he was a child and had loved them well. He
thought of the hosts who had loved the church bells,
who loved them yet; of the sweetness and peace
and musical memory they were to many—to very
many; of the thousand associations, hovering like
overtones, thoughts of old faces, old scenes, old
gladnesses. He saw old, peaceful faces of men and
women who had made their religion a religion of
love and had loved the church bells. Waves of fragrant
memories came to Aderhold himself—days
of a serious, quiet childhood when he had pondered
over Bible stories; when in some leafy garden corner,
or on his bed at night, he had gone in imagination
step by step through that drama of Judea,
figuring himself as a boy who followed, as, maybe, a
younger brother of the beloved John. It came back
to him—as, indeed, it had never left him—the
soft and bright and good, the pristine part, the
Jesus part, the natural part. <i>Do unto others as thou
wouldst have others do unto you</i>—<i>Love thy neighbour
as thyself</i>—<i>I say unto you until seventy times seven
times</i>—</p>

<p>The church bells! The church bells! But they
had swung him here into this narrow place and dark,
and they would swing him into a darker and a narrower.
They had swung Joan Heron there where
she stood against the wall.... The many and the
many and the many they had rung and swung to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
torture, infamy, and death! The church bells! They
rang in the name of a gentle heart, but they rang
also for the savage and poor guesses, the ferocities,
the nomad imagination of an ancient, early people.
They rang for Oriental ideas of despot and slave,
thrones and princes, glittering reward of eternal,
happy indolence, fearful punishment of eternal physical
torment and ignominy! They rang head beneath
the foot, and he that raiseth voice against this Order,
not his body only, but his soul and his memory
shall be flayed!... Palestine or England, what did
it matter? Caiaphas or the Christian Church?...
The searching, questing spirit that, age by age, lifted
from the lower past toward the light of further
knowledge, larger scope—and the past that, age
by age, hurled its bolts and let its arrows fly and
rang its iron bells against that spirit.... The bells
rang and rang. He heard them sweet and softened
across the years and knew that many loved them
and held them holy; he heard them ring, jubilantly,
above many a martyr’s stake, massacre, war, and
torture chamber, ring the knell of just questioning,
ring the burial, for yet longer and yet longer, of the
truth of things; and knew that many, and those not
the least worthy, must abhor them. He had loved
them, too, but to-day he loved them not. They
clanged with a hoarse old sound of savage gong and
drum and tube calling to the sacrifice....</p>

<p>Between morning and midday the door opened
and his red-faced, wry-mouthed friend of the Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
wars appeared. “Two of the commissioners would
talk with you.” They climbed the stairs leading
from the darkness, and passed again through that
long and narrow room. But though there were prisoners
here, Joan Heron was not among them. The
gaoler turned to the left and, opening a door, signed
to him to enter a fair-sized, well-lighted room where
were chairs and a table. The light dazzled him,
coming from the almost night underfoot. When his
vision cleared he saw that the two who awaited him
were the minister of Hawthorn and Master Harry
Carthew.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">ADERHOLD AND CARTHEW</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Master Clement</span> sat, tense and straight, spiritually
girded to meet Satan and his legionaries.
Harry Carthew was standing when Aderhold entered
the room, but immediately he came and sat
beside the minister, his eyes, deep-set in a pale, fever-wasted
countenance, regarding, not unsteadily, the
prisoner. He had risen from his bed but a week ago;
this was the first time he had ridden to the town.
There was something strange in his countenance,
a look now vacillating, now fixed and hardened. He
held his gloves in one hand and drew them through
the other with a repeated motion.</p>

<p>“Give you good-day, Master Aderhold,” he said
in a controlled, toneless voice.</p>

<p>“Give you good-day, Master Carthew.”</p>

<p>The minister’s strong sing-song pierced the air.
“Thou guilty and wretched man! We have left
thee so long to hug thy own mind because there
was much work elsewhere to do! To-day we would
have thee bethink thyself. Thy sorcery at the Oak
Grange and in Hawthorn Forest and elsewhere is
wholly discovered! Thy fellows in iniquity are all
taken, and sufficient have confessed to set thee at
the stake! Why continue to deny—adding so to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
heat of that hell which awaits thee—thy doings
in this nature? What use to say that thou didst not,
leaving thy double in the constable’s hands, return
in the storm upon the Hawthorn road, and by the
power of Satan affront and stay and with thy devil-furnished
dagger wound Master Harry Carthew?”</p>

<p>“What use, indeed!” said Aderhold. “And yet
I say it.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Master Clement, and the veins
upon his forehead began to swell, “thou art a foolish
poor atheist! What! when thou art compact of
denial, and will be lost from earth and heaven because
of that, dost think that one denial more will
serve thee? Come! Thou struckest the blow, we
know. What witch had come at thy call and was
with thee, standing on the hill brow, weaving and
beckoning the storm?”</p>

<p>“What witch?” echoed Aderhold, startled. “Nor
I was there nor any other!”</p>

<p>Harry Carthew had not ceased to draw the gloves
held in one hand through the other. He sat with
downcast eyes, wasted and sombre, more wasted,
more haggard, and overlaid with the dull tint of
tragedy than Aderhold himself. He spoke now with
a flushed cheek. “Let that go by! It matters not
what hand struck me in the side that night—” He
turned on Aderhold. “That which I must know, and
will know, I tell you—” Shaken by passion he
pushed back his chair, and rising moved with a disordered
step the length of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Master Clement could not let pass the first part of
his speech. “Not so, Harry Carthew! What! Matters
not that you should be brought to death’s door
by the stroke of a wizard misbeliever—”</p>

<p>Carthew again approached the table. “It matters
not, I say. Unless—” He stood looking fixedly at
Aderhold, the breath coming quickly from between
his lips. “It has been confessed that you met these
witches and wantoned with them at the sabbats in
Hawthorn Wood.... Now, I have been sick and
my senses wandering, and I have come but lately
back into this enquiry. Much has happened—much
has been done—much has been laid bare that
I knew naught of. In particular—” He broke
away, walked again the length of the room; then
returning, stood above Master Clement in his great
chair and urged some course in an undertone.</p>

<p>Master Clement first demurred, then, though
without alacrity, acquiesced. “Is it well for you to
be alone with him? I tell you the Devil hath such
wiles—But since you wish it, I will go—I will go
for a short while.” He heaved his slight, black
figure from the chair, and, moving stiffly, quitted
the room. The gaoler stood yet at the door, but, at
a sign from Carthew, without, not within, the room.</p>

<p>The squire’s brother had his own strength. It
exhibited itself now. He stilled his hurried breathing,
ceased the nervous motion of his hands, indefinably
broadened and heightened his frame, and
became the strong, Puritan country gentleman, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
future officer of Ironsides. Whatever there was in
him of stanch and firm and good so struggled with
what was darkly passionate that, for these minutes
at least, there rose on the horizon something that
was not the tempest-tossed ship of many months.
The masts seemed to cease to bend, the anchor to
hold again.</p>

<p>He stood within five feet of Aderhold. He had
moved so that the table was no longer between them.
In doing so, the attitude of advantage and mastership
had been lost. The two stood on a level floor,
with no conventional judgement bar between them.
If in Carthew, beneath murk and tempest, there
appeared for the moment something basic, justified,
and ultimate, in Aderhold no less character
unveiled its mass. He stood in chains, but they
seemed ribbons of mist. It was he that was metal
and real, and with a sudden loom and resistive force
sent back, broken, doubts and fantastic violences of
thought and ascription. Though for a short time
only, yet for that time, the tattered farrago of superstitions,
hanging in Carthew’s mind like mouldering
banners of wars whose very reason was forgot,
shrunk and shrivelled until they seemed but featureless
dust. For a time he ceased, standing here, to believe
in Aderhold’s attendance at sabbats, brewings
of poison from baleful herbs, toads, spiders, and
newts, and midnight conspirings in the interests of
the Kingdom of Satan. Even the acknowledged,
monstrous sin, the extravagant, the unpardonable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the monarch and includer of all—even the enormity
of Unbelief—wavered in his mind, grew unsubstantial.
There was a fact of great force before
him, a mass, a reality.... But if, for one larger,
saner moment, he rejected belief in a supernatural
bond of evil linking together Aderhold and Joan
Heron, he by no means did this with the possibility
of other bonds—evil also if they existed between
these two—evil to him as wormwood, darkness,
and madness!</p>

<p>“In particular,” he said, in a voice that thickened
as he went on, “I am told that they have taken Joan
Heron. I had never thought of that—of her coming
under suspicion.... I had never thought of that.
I do not yet believe her to be a witch—though indeed
they bring all manner of accusation and proof
against her—but I will not yet believe it.... But
I will have from thee what has been thy power over
her! Tell me that, thou atheist!”</p>

<p>“My power over her has been naught and is
naught. I have spoken with her seldomer than I
have spoken with you. I have had no association
with her. Why she should be in this gaol I know
not.”</p>

<p>“It is proved that the morning after you were
lodged here she came into this square, and stood
before this prison, making signs.”</p>

<p>“I know naught of that. What does she say herself?”</p>

<p>“She says that she had walked to the castle to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
one there, and coming back, paused but a moment in
the square. She says she made no signs.”</p>

<p>“And is it so hard to believe what she says?”</p>

<p>Carthew drew a heavy and struggling breath.
“There is a passion, I think, that teacheth all human
beings to lie.... It is said, and loudly, that
you came to Heron’s cottage by night, and that
she went to the Oak Grange by night, and that you
were paramours.”</p>

<p>“It is false. I neither went so to Heron’s cottage
nor did she come so to the Grange, nor were we paramours.”</p>

<p>“That day I found you together in Hawthorn
Wood—”</p>

<p>“Do you remember what I said to you? That was
the truth.”</p>

<p>“Not one hour afterward I was told that often—oh,
often and often!—you walked together in
the forest.”</p>

<p>“Then you were falsely told. It was not so.”</p>

<p>“Was the truth—and ‘is’ the truth.—You
are earnest to clear her from every shadow of association
with you. Why?”</p>

<p>“Why?” Aderhold’s eyelids flickered. “Why?
It seems to me easy to know why. I was not born
of so low condition that I would see the innocent
dragged to a place like this.”</p>

<p>A moment’s dead silence; then Carthew spoke
with a regathered and dangerous passion. “Others
are here—dragged here for their own sinful activities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and accused likewise of being your hail fellows
and boon companions. There are here a youth to
whom it is said you taught atheism, and Mother
Spuraway and Grace Maybank and your housekeeper
at the Grange and others. Do you grieve for
them that they are here?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Aderhold; “I grieve for them.
Piteous, wronged souls! I tell you, I have had
naught to do with them, nor they with me!”</p>

<p>Carthew’s voice quivered, and he struck one hand
into the other. “Words are locked doors, but not the
voice with which the words are uttered! ‘Piteous
wronged souls’ that my gentleman born of no low
condition feels grief for and would deliver if he
might from gaol and judgement—and Joan Heron
whom his voice only trembles not before, only
caresses not because he would guard her from the
ruin of his favour!—What good to loom there against
me and thrust that, too, from you? You love her!
You love her! And now I will know if she loves you!
And when I know that I will know what I shall do!”</p>

<p>“You are mad! Her life and mine touch not,
save as this Hawthorn music jangles our names together!
I shall presently be dead. I know it, and
you know it. Leave her living, her and these others!
You have the power. Leave them living!”</p>

<p>“Power!” the other burst forth. “I have no
power to save her. She is bound with a hundred
cords! Had I not fallen ill I might have—or I
might have not— But now it is too late. I cannot!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>”
His helplessness was real enough, and it made—if
he would not feel it too crushingly—a dark
bubbling-up of heat, violence, murky and passionate
substance a necessity to him. He gave it way.</p>

<p>Aderhold saw the change, the resurgence. He
made with his chained hands a stately and mournful
gesture. “As it will be!” he said.</p>

<p>The other burst forth. “Aye, I believe—I believe
that you have poisoned and corrupted her, and
that there is truth in every word they say! Now as I
am a baptised man there is truth! For you are an
unbeliever and God’s enemy! And is not God’s
enemy of necessity black and corrupt and a liar to
the last particle of his being, to the last hair of his
head, to the paring of his nails! More—you have
stood there weaving a spell to make me listen and
well-nigh believe! Well, your spell will not hold me!—As
God liveth I hold it to be true that you met by
night in Hawthorn Forest—”</p>

<p>“Look at me!” said Aderhold. “That is as true as
that it was I who struck a dagger into you on a
Sunday night! <i>Now</i> you know how true it is!”</p>

<p>Carthew gave back a step and went deadly white.
There was within him that root of grace that he had
risen from his sick bed with his first madness lessened
and his mind set on managing a correction in
the minds alike of Hawthorn and the commission.
In the first wild turmoil and anger, pushing home
under the half-moon from Heron’s cottage, blood
staining his doublet and his head beginning to swim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
he had seized—it coming to him upon some blast of
the wind that he must find and presently give a reason
for his condition—he had seized the first dark
inspiration. It had answered—he had found on
stepping from weeks of stupor and delirium that it
had answered so well and thoroughly that now—always
below the Unbelief and Blasphemy—it was
one of the main counts against the physician. He
had thought to be able to cast hesitancy and doubt
on his original assertion. It was dark—the figure
was cloaked—it might not have been the leech....
He found that he could corrupt no one’s belief that it
was the leech—Hawthorn, his brother, Master
Clement, the commission, all were unshakable. He
knew not himself how to shatter their conviction. He
could not so injure his own name and fame, the
strict religion, the coming England, the great services
which he meant yet to perform, as to stand and
say, “I lied.” He could see that even if he said it, he
would not be believed. They would say, “Your
fever still confuses your head.” Or they might say,
“They are casting their spells still.” Or they might
ask, “Who, then, struck you?”... It was impossible....
Even did they believe it, what would it
alter? Nothing! The apostate and sorcerer was
in any event doomed. A straw more or less would
make no difference. Surely one out of the circle of
God’s mercy need not be too closely considered....
But he paled with the issue thrown so by the man
himself between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>He paled; then desperately opened the gates to
anger the restorative, and jealousy that shredded
shame to the winds. Moreover, there flashed into
his soul in storm a suspicion. “Who struck me?
Knowest thou <i>that</i>? If thou knowest that, then,
indeed—”</p>

<p>But Aderhold knew not that. He stood with
folded arms and a steady face. It was now to summon
the ancient virtue, to play truly the Republican,
the free man, now to summon courage for
others. Life! Life! And what men and women had
suffered would be suffered again. And still the ether
sprang clear and time stretched endlessly, and what
was lost here might be found there. He looked at
Harry Carthew with a steadfast face, and reckoned
that the younger man was unhappier than he.</p>

<p>The door opened with a heavy sound and Master
Clement reappeared. Carthew flung himself toward
him, his face distorted. “Naught—naught! And
now I think the worst—I tell you I think the
worst—”</p>

<p>“I have always thought the worst,” said Master
Clement. “Send him hence now, and let us see these
others.”</p>

<p>... Aderhold moved before the red-faced, wry-mouthed
gaoler through the dark passageway and
down the stair, back to the chill and darkness of his
dungeon. Within it, the gaoler made a moment’s
pause before he should turn and, departing, shut
the thick door with the sound of a falling slab of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
sepulchre. He stood, to the eye a rude and portentous
figure, but to the inward vision giving off at
times relieving glints.</p>

<p>“Everything goes,” he said in a deep and rusty
voice, “by looking at more than just itself. In another
day in England or in another country to-day,
you’d have been racked or put to the scarpines till,
when they wanted you, we’d have had to carry you!”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” said Aderhold. “One
should have a grateful heart!... True enough—as
I know—as I know!”</p>

<p>“It’s ten days to assizes,” said the gaoler. “It
isn’t lawful to put folk to the question in England—though
if you stand mute, there’s <i>peine forte et
dure</i>—and of course nobody’s going to do anything
that isn’t lawful! But you know yourself there are
ways—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Aderhold. “Do you mean that they
will be used?”</p>

<p>But the gaoler grew surly again. “I don’t know
anything except that they want your confession.
They’ve got a story that’s going to be sold in chap-books
all over England—and ballads made—and
of course they want all the strange things in. It’s like
the pictures of George and the Dragon—the more
dreadful the dragon, the taller man is the George!
The town’s all abuzz—with the King writing a
learned letter, and the bishop coming and the Witch
Judge.—They want a dreadful dragon and the tallest
kind of George!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see,” said Aderhold. “Even the dragon, the
spear at his throat, expected to flatter!—O Diogenes!
let us laugh, if we die for it!”</p>

<p>“Anan?” said the gaoler. “Well, it stands that
way.”</p>

<p>The door shut behind him, grating and heavy.
That it stood that way Aderhold found in the days
that followed....</p>

<p>It drew toward assizes. Five days before the time
he found himself one late afternoon, after a weary,
weary hour of facing the commission, again in the
long, dusky prison room where he had seen Joan.
He knew now that it was a kind of antechamber, a
place where prisoners were drawn together to wait
occasions. More than once during these last days
he had been kept here for minutes at a time, and
sometimes others had been here and sometimes
not. But Joan Heron never. One day he had seen
Dorothy, and in passing had managed a moment’s
word. “Dorothy, Dorothy! I am sorry—” Dorothy
had gasped and shrunk aside. “Oh, wicked
man! Oh, Master Aderhold—” He had seen also
the youth with a clear passion for knowledge to
whom he had lent books and talked of Copernicus
and Galileo. This one had not been fearful of him.</p>

<p>To-day he saw neither this youth nor Dorothy.
But suddenly, as he stood waiting his gaoler’s leisure,
he was aware of Joan Heron.... From somewhere
came a red sunset light, and it followed and
enwrapped her as she moved. She was moving with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
her arm in the grasp of a man of a curious and sinister
look—moving by the wall at the end of the
room—moving across, then back again, across
again and back, across and back.... Aderhold drew
near, and it was as though an iron hand closed hard
upon and wrung his heart.</p>

<p>Joan went very slowly, dragging her limbs, more
haled by the man than moving of volition. Her
form swayed, seemed as if all and only its desire was
to sink together, fall upon the earth and lie there
with time and motion ended in one stroke. Her
head was sunken forward, her eyes closed.</p>

<p>The man shook her savagely. “No sleeping!—When
you are willing to tell your witch deeds, then
you shall sleep!”</p>

<p>“Joan! Joan!” cried Aderhold. He moved beside
the two. The man looked at him but, stupid or curious,
neither thrust him off nor dragged his charge
away. It was but for a moment.</p>

<p>Joan opened her eyes. “You?” she said. “All I
want is to sleep, sleep—”</p>

<p>Her face was ghastly, exhausted. Aderhold
uttered a groan. “Do they not let you sleep either?”
she said. “Five days, five nights—and I am
thirsty, too.”</p>

<p>He managed to touch her hand. “Joan, Joan—”</p>

<p>She looked at him with lustreless eyes. “The
others have all made up something to confess. But
though I die, I will not. They may twist a cord
around my head and I will not.” A spasm crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
her face. “Of their vileness they may set the witch-pricker
on me and I will not.” Her voice, monotonous
and low, died away. The man haled her by
the arm, forcing her to walk. She reeled against
him. “Sleep ... sleep. Oh, let me sleep!” A door
opened. The man with her looked up, nodded,
put his hands on both her shoulders and pushed
her toward it. Her eyes closed again, her head sank
forward. Together the two vanished, leaving to
Aderhold a sense of midnight and the abyss.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WITCH JUDGE</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">The Witch Judge</span> sat high; beside him his circuit
fellow who was a nonentity; a step or two lower
a row of local magistrates. The hall was large and
high,—time-darkened, powdered with amber sunshine
entering through narrow windows. The commission
that had so zealously discharged its duties
had a place of honour. The bishop was seated as
high as the judge, around him those of the clergy
who did not sit with the commission. The earl was
away from the castle, but at an early moment in the
proceedings there came in his kinsman, Sir Richard.
One of the justices whispered to the nonentity-judge,
who whispered to the Witch Judge. The
Witch Judge stopped short in a foaming and thunderous
speech and waited until the earl’s kinsman
should be seated. His air recognized the importance
of the entrance; he slightly inclined his enormous,
grizzled head, then returned to his hurtling thunders.</p>

<p>The jury sat in its place. Farmers and tradesmen,
it sat a stolid twelve, and believed implicitly that one
who said that there was truth in the Bible, and also
that which was not truth must be hanged or burned.
What else was there to do with him? It had as firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
an assurance that your misbeliever was always your
necromancer. Indeed, you exhibited and proved the
wickedness of his unbelieving by the nauseous ill of
his conduct. That was why examiners and commissions
sought always until they found the thread that
led to Satan’s visible ownership. As for the Hawthorn
witches—the jury saw them hanging in a row,
and purposed buying the ballads that would certainly
be made.</p>

<p>The hall was crowded. It was the most exciting
kind of trial that could happen—barring only,
perhaps, an occasional case of <i>lèse majesté</i>. But this
was also <i>lèse majesté</i>. They all saw God as a King
with a gold crown and throne and court; and Satan
as a derision-covered rebel, and his imps and servants
very ugly—when they were not at times very
beautiful—and doom like a Traitor’s Gate, and
hell a Tower from which there was never any coming
forth.... And it was good to feel such loyal subjects,
and to marvel and cry out, “Eh, sirs! To
think of any thinking that!”... The hall was
crowded, hot, and jostling. Young and old were here,
full means and narrow means, lettered and unlettered,
town and country,—for many walked each day
from Hawthorn,—birth and the commonalty, they
who held with the Episcopacy, and they who were
turning Puritan, zealots and future sectaries, shepherds
and sheep! And the neighbours of the accused—as
many as could get here—and those who had
sat with them in Hawthorn Church—and the witnesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and sufferers, fresh numbers of these being
continually discovered. Now the hall held its breath
while a witness was being questioned, or the counsel
for the Crown spoke, or the Witch Judge thundered,
and now it buzzed and hummed like the bees that
they said were bewitched. Heat, many bodies in contact
and a mist of breaths, an old, old contagion of
opinion old as savagery....</p>

<p>The Witch Judge was to most a fearful delight.
No silent, listening, seldom-speaking judge was he!
He had a voice like rolling thunder and an animus
against just those wrongs judgement upon which
had swelled his reputation. He overbore; he thundered
in where Jove would have left matters to lesser
divinities; he questioned, answered, tried, and
judged. He loved to hear his own voice and took
and made occasions. Nor would he hasten to the
end, but preferred to draw matters out in long reverberations.
He was prepared to give a week, if
need be, to this trial which was concluded ere he
took his seat. In all, in the Hawthorn matter, there
were eight folk to be tried. Destroy one, destroy all,
principal and accessories, the whole hung together!
But he was prepared with devices and flourishes, and
for each soul on trial specific attention and cat-and-mouse
play, for the Witch Judge loved to show his
variousness.... The practice of the age was everywhere
elastic enough, but in no trials so licensed as in
such as this. What need for scruples when you dealt
with Satan?... No counsel was allowed the prisoners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
If ever there was floating in the air a notion
that the judge should be counsel for prisoners,
guarding them from injustice and oppression, it had
made no lodgement in this judge’s ear.</p>

<p>The writ <i>de hæretico comburendo</i>! The Witch Judge
thundered forth the text of it, then preached his
sermon. This wretched man, this wicked leech, this
miscreant, blasphemer, and infidel had made confession
of his crime of apostasy—the most enormous
under heaven—confessing it without tears,
shame, or penitence! Confessing! nay, avowing,
upholding—The Witch Judge glowed fuliginous;
his voice of horror seemed to come from the caverns
of the earth. “He denieth the actuality of the Holy
Trinity—he saith that the world was not made in
six days and is not composed and constructed as set
forth in the Holy Scriptures—he refuseth to believe
in the remission of sins by the shedding of blood—No
language nor tongues,” cried the Witch Judge,
“can set forth the enormity of his error, sin, and
crime! Let him burn, as God saith he will burn,
through eternity and back again!” The phrase
caught the fancy of the throng. It came back in a
deep and satisfied murmur. <i>Through eternity and
back again.</i></p>

<p>On crackled and roared the Witch Judge’s thunder.
Convict by manifold testimony and impeccable
witnesses, and wholly and terminably convict by his
own confession without violence, it remained—the
authority of Holy Religion and the Ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Court being present in the person of my Lord Bishop—it
remained but to give judgement and pass sentence
upon the apostate! In regard to his apostasy.
But this wicked leech rested also under a charge of
sorcery—sorcery of the blackest—sorcery which he
obdurately denied! Let him, then, before judgement
given, be tried for his sorcery—he with these
wretched others, for Satan hunteth not with one
beagle, but with many!</p>

<p>The Witch Judge half rose, puffed himself forth,
became more than ever a bolt-darting Jupiter.
Trials for heresy, apostasy, blasphemy were not in
themselves wholly his element. But let them darken
and lower—as indeed, they almost always did darken
and lower—into questions of actual physical contact
and trade dealings with the Hereditary Foe, then he
was in his element!... Wizards and witches! The
Witch Judge shook his hand above the prisoners.
“And let not any think Witchcraft to be other or less
than Apostasy, Idolatry, and Blasphemy! If Apostasy
is the Devil’s right hand, Witchcraft makes his
left—his left? Nay, his right and most powerful,
for here is your apostate in action—here is your unbeliever
upon his Lord Satan’s business!” Witchcraft!
Witchcraft! The Witch Judge paced around,
threw lurid lights upon the crime he battened on.
His tribute of huge words rolled beneath the groined
roof and shook the hearts of the fearful. There came
back from the crowd a sighing and muttering, half-ecstatic,
half-terrified, low sound. The word of God—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
command of the Most High, taken from his
own lips—the plainest order of the King of Kings.—<i>Thou
shall not suffer a witch to live</i>.... Statute of
the first year of our present Gracious Sovereign, our
lord, King James—<i>All persons invoking any evil
spirit, or consulting, covenanting with, entertaining,
employing, feeding, or rewarding any evil spirit, or taking
up dead bodies from their graves to be used in any
witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment, or killing or
otherwise hurting any person by such infernal arts, are
declared guilty of felony without benefit of clergy and
shall suffer death.</i> He had a way of uttering “death”
that made the word a distillation of all the suffering
man could make for man.</p>

<p>Preliminary thunders from the Witch Judge
ceased. Counsel for the Crown came afterwards like
a whistling wind. The long Hawthorn Witch Trial
began, and stretched from midsummer day to day.
To many it afforded an exciting, day-by-day renewed
entertainment; to some it was a fearful dream;
to a very few, perhaps, it seemed a long, dull, painful
watch by mortality’s fever bed. Once Aderhold
caught the gaze of the earl’s kinsman upon him.
The eyes of the two met and agreed as to what was
passing, then Aderhold looked away.</p>

<p>The prisoners had their appointed space. At
times they were all brought together here; at times
the greater number were withdrawn, leaving one or
two to be examined separately or together. The heat
and the light struck against them, and the waves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
sound; from one side came the booming of the
judge’s voice or the dry shrilling of the king’s lawyer;
from the other the whisper of the crowd that meant
to have witch blood. There were Aderhold, the
youth to whom he had given books, the boy of sixteen,
old Dorothy’s nephew, Dorothy herself, a halfwitted
woman from a hut between the Grange and
the North-End Farm, Grace Maybank, Mother
Spuraway, and Joan Heron—eight in all.</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway—Now torture was not allowed
in England, though on the Continent and in
Scotland it flared in witch trials to its fullest height.
Mother Spuraway, therefore, had not been tortured—no
more than Aderhold, no more than Joan, no
more than others. But it was allowable, where confession
did not come easily, to hasten it with fasting
from bread, water, and sleep—all these being withholdings,
not inflictings. There might be, too, insistent,
long-continued questionings and threats and a
multitude of small gins and snares. Mother Spuraway
had been long weeks in gaol, and she was old
and her faculties, once good, were perhaps not now
hard to break down. At any rate, she had a ghastly
look and a broken. Since she trembled so that she
could not stand, they put her into a chair.</p>

<p>“Now answer strictly the questions asked you,
if you have any hope of mercy!”</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway put her two trembling hands to
her head. “Mercy? Yes, sirs, that is what I want.
Mercy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well, then! Look on this man and tell us
what you know of him.”</p>

<p>The clerks’ pens began to scratch.</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway’s gaze was so wandering that
while it came across Aderhold, it went on at once to
a cobweb above the judge’s chair. “He is the
Devil,” she said.</p>

<p>“You mean the Devil’s servant.”</p>

<p>“Yes—oh, yes! Devil’s servant. I mean just
what Your Honours want.”</p>

<p>The Witch Judge thundered at her. “Woman! it
is not what <i>we</i> want. You are to speak the truth.
Truth-speaking is what we want.”</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway’s head nodded, her eyes fallen
now from the cobweb to the judge’s robe. “Yes, sirs—yes,
sirs. You shall have what you want. Oh, yes,
sirs!”</p>

<p>“She asserts,” said the counsel for the Crown,
“that she tells the truth.—You were used to going
to sabbats with this man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sirs,—sabbats, sabbats, sabbats, sabbats—”</p>

<p>“Give her wine,” said the Witch Judge. “She is
old. Let her rally herself. Give her wine.”</p>

<p>A gaoler set a cup to her lips and she drank.
“Now,” said the Crown, “tell us of these sabbats—circumstantially.”</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway, revived by the wine, looked
from floor to roof and roof to floor and at the commission
and the Witch Judge and the bishop, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the motes in a broken shaft of light. “We danced
about the burned cot—all taking hands—so!
Sometimes of dark nights we went <i>widdershins</i>
around Hawthorn Church—sometimes it was
around the fairy oak at the Oak Grange. Sometimes
we danced and sometimes we flew. We rode in
the air. I had an oaken horse—and Grace had an
elmen horse and Dorothy had a willow horse, and
Elspeth No-Wit had a beechen horse, and Marget
Primrose had a horse of yew—”</p>

<p>There was a movement among the commission.
“Marget Primrose,” exclaimed Squire Carthew,
“died years ago!”</p>

<p>“She came back. Marget had a yew horse—and
I had an oaken horse—and there were other horses,
but I never learned their names. And there were
green men—”</p>

<p>“Was this man in green?”</p>

<p>“No, no! He had on a doctor’s cloak. Sometimes
he fiddled for us when Satan grew tired.”</p>

<p>“Then he was a chief among you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, a chief among us.—Sometimes we
changed to bats and mice and harmless green frogs
and hares and owls and other creatures—”</p>

<p>“You did that when you were about to go to
folk’s houses or fields to injure them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sirs, yes, yes—about to injure them.
Then I was a dog, and Grace a little brown hare, and
Dorothy a great frog, and Elspeth No-Wit a bat,
and Marget Primrose—And we brewed poisons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
charms in a great cauldron inside the burned cot,
but at the fairy oak we made little figures out of
river clay and stuck them full of pins. And there we
had a feast—”</p>

<p>“And this man?”</p>

<p>“He sat on the green hillock beside Satan, and
Satan had a black book. He gave it to him to read
in while we were dancing and eating and daffing
with the green men—and then the cock crew and
we all flew home.”</p>

<p>“There were many sabbats?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, many!”</p>

<p>“And this man was always among you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, always among us.”</p>

<p>“You say he read in a black book. But he likewise
danced and wantoned as did the green men?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! The pretty green men.”</p>

<p>“Be careful now. With whom especially did he
work this iniquity? Whom did he single out at each
sabbat?”</p>

<p>“Whom?—I do not know whom.... Sabbats?
There are no such things. Who would leave home at
night to wander round oak trees and burned cots?—Oh,
home, home! Oh, my hut! I want to see my
hut!” cried Mother Spuraway. “Oh, good gentlemen!
Oh, Your Worships! Oh, Squire Carthew—Master
Clement!—Won’t you let me go home? A
poor old woman that never harmed a soul—”</p>

<p>The Witch Judge’s voice came thundering down.
“Her mind is wandering!—Thou wretched woman!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Dost wish to be taken back to thy prison, and
urged anew to confess?”</p>

<p>But apparently Mother Spuraway did not wish
that. She put up her two hands and said, “No, no!”—then,
shrunken and shuddering, begged for more
wine. They gave it to her.... “Now, whom did
this sorcerer take in his arms? Was it the <i>maiden</i> of
your company?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes! The maiden.”</p>

<p>“The maiden of your company was Joan Heron?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Joan Heron.”</p>

<p class="p2">The shafts of light were shortening, the earth wheeling
toward sunset. Without clanged the bells of the
great church—it was late afternoon. The people
who had far to walk, though loath for the entertainment
to cease, yet approved when the court rose for
that day. Morning would not be long, and they purposed
returning most early in order that good places
might be got. The hall and the square without
seethed and sounded with the dispersing crowd.</p>

<p>Near at hand was the prison, its black mass facing
the great square, the pillory in its shadow; beyond,
slanting down to the river, the field where they
raised the gallows. The prisoners when they were
removed were taken, guarded, along by the wall,
into the dark, gaping prison mouth.</p>

<p>Joan walked beside Mother Spuraway. In the
last three or four days the hand of withholding had
been lifted from the prisoners so that they might get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
their strength.... Joan walked with a colourless,
thin cheek and shadowed eyes, but walked steadily.
But Mother Spuraway could not drag her limbs
across the stones; a gaoler held her roughly up with
a force that drew a moan. Presently, his grasp
relaxing, she stumbled again and fell. Joan stooped
and raised her, then with her arm about her bore
her on. “Thank’ee, my pretty maid,” said Mother
Spuraway. “I’ll do as much for you when you are
old!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WITCH</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">The</span> morrow came and went in heat and tenseness
and excitement. The third day arrived and passed
with no lessening. The fourth day came and the
fever ran more high than before. The Crown, the
jury, and the Witch Judge, the throng nodding
approval, had now checked off Mother Spuraway,
Grace Maybank, Dorothy and her nephew, Elspeth
No-Wit, and the youth. It remained on this day to
concentrate upon and finally dash to earth the main
sorcerer and that one who patently had been his
paramour and adjutant—the “maiden” of the
wicked crew. There were many witnesses and much
wild testimony. Small facts were puffed out to
become monstrous symbols. Where facts failed, the
inflamed and morbid imagination invented. It was
strange hearing to the two who had dwelled at the
Oak Grange and Heron’s cottage....</p>

<p>They questioned Elspeth No-Wit. “You had a
meeting the night before the leech was taken?”</p>

<p>Elspeth laughed and nodded.</p>

<p>“What did you do there?”</p>

<p>“We had a big kettle and a great fire. Everybody
dropped what she loved best in the kettle. We
played and clapped hands and jumped as high as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the tree-tops. When we clapped our hands, it
thundered, and when we ran around the kettle the
wind blew our clothes away.”</p>

<p>“You were brewing the storm that broke next
day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, aye!”</p>

<p>“The leech and Joan Heron were with you?”</p>

<p>Elspeth twisted her body and peered around. “Is
that Joan Heron and is that the leech? They ran
round thrice to our once, and they kissed the closest,
and at last they wandered away.”</p>

<p>Will the smith’s son was called. “You stopped at
Heron’s cottage that Sunday evening?”</p>

<p>Will stammered, looking wild, hollow-eyed, and
awed. “Aye, I did, please Your Honour!—But I
never would have stopped but that it was storming
so.—My mother was with me, please you, sir.”</p>

<p>“No one means you any ill.—It was dark under
the clouds without, but there was a light inside the
cottage—a red light?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; bright like firelight.”</p>

<p>“Hardly, I think, true firelight: a red and strange
light.—It was well after the hour when the leech
had been taken from this Oak Grange?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Your Honour. ’Twas close to dark.”</p>

<p>“With the constable and his men, and Master
Carthew riding a part of the way, he must then have
been upon the Hawthorn road, his face set to this
gaol?”</p>

<p>“He must have been so, sir, but—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are coming to that. It is a fact, is it not, that
witches and warlocks are able to transport themselves,
with their master Satan’s aid, through the
air—and that so swiftly that you cannot see their
flight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Your Honour,” said Will. “They fly in
sieves, and sometimes they steal bats’ wings.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now you and your mother opened
this cottage gate and went up the path to the door,
and to reach that you had to pass the window. As
you did that, passing close, you naturally put forehead
to the frame, and looked within, and the place
being filled with that red light—”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t very bright,” said Will. “It was like a
faggot had parted on the hearth, and there was
now a dancing light, and now it was dark. There
was nothing clear, and we heard naught because it
was lightning and thundering—”</p>

<p>“And you saw—”</p>

<p>Will moistened his lips. “Yes, sir.—She and a
black man were together—yes, please Your Honour,
standing locked together—”</p>

<p>“The black man was the leech?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know it, then, sir—How could we,”
said Will, “when he was three miles the other side of
Hawthorn with a guard? But I know it now. It was
the leech.—And mother and I went on and knocked
at the door, and she opened it—and there was
nobody there but Joan—Joan and the grey and
white cat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“You stayed no time in that cottage?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, please Your Honour. There was that
that frightened us.”</p>

<p>Will the smith’s son was motioned down. They
set Mother Spuraway again in the eye of the court—Mother
Spuraway, wrecked until she was nigh of the
fellowship of Elspeth No-Wit. “You have told us
that on this Sunday evening you were running in the
shape of a hare through field and copse by the Hawthorn
road. We have obtained from you that you
saw the leech part from his natural body, having
by black magic so blinded the guard that they went
on bearing with them but a shadow, a double, and
yet unsuspecting that cheat. Now tell us what the
sorcerer did.”</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway plucked at the stuff of her
kirtle. “He mounted in the air.—Storm—storm—break
storm!”</p>

<p>“He went toward Hawthorn Wood?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes! Hawthorn Wood.... Rue around
the burned cot.”</p>

<p>“That is, toward Heron’s cottage.—A time
passed, and you, crouching then in the hazels by the
road, saw him returning.—Now, mark! Was there
a horseman upon this same Hawthorn road?”</p>

<p>Mother Spuraway tried to mark, but her mind
was wandering again. She preferred, it seemed, to
talk of when she was a young woman and Spuraway
and she had wandered, hand in hand, in Hawthorn
Wood. But one wrenched her arm, and said something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
in her ear and brought her back with a shiver.
“‘Horseman’? Oh, aye, Your Worships! A great,
noble horseman.”</p>

<p>“You saw the leech coming across the fields from
the direction of Heron’s cottage, and you saw this
horseman riding through the storm toward Hawthorn
Village. What then?”</p>

<p>“I ran under the earth,” said Mother Spuraway.
“For I was now a pretty black mole, dressed all in
velvet and blind—blind—blind—blind—”</p>

<p>It was with a different—oh, a different, different
tone that they questioned Master Harry Carthew
and harkened solicitously to what he had to
tell. All the crowded place leaned forward and listened,
in the hot, slanted gold of the fourth afternoon....
Joan saw them all, and saw into their
minds prone before the foreknown truth of whatever
Master Carthew was about to recount. She sat like
carven marble and viewed and knew the world she
viewed. She saw Alison and Cecily, Will and his
mother, Goodman Cole, the forester’s wife, Lukin
the carter, the tinker, many others. She saw Master
Clement and all the clergy and gentry of the commission,
the court, the spectators. She saw the
Witch Judge who was going to hang her. And
townspeople with whom she had had acquaintance....
The vintner who had wished to marry her was
here, pale and of a tremendous inward thankfulness.
And servants from the castle, and the new huntsman....
All here to see her hunted—her and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
others. She felt their tongues go over their lips, and
the warm indrawing of their shoulders and nursing
of their elbows—felt and cared not.</p>

<p>Carthew was speaking in a hollow, short, determined
voice. If a black lava torrent of passion and
madness was devastating his soul, few enough knew
it of all in that thronged place.... At no previous
time had there been such soundlessness in the hall,
such keyed and strained attention. Hawthorn, at
least, believed that Master Harry Carthew was to
be a great man in England, was to climb high, with
the Bible in his hand. For the town, that was of
another cast of opinion,—if it conceived of him
hardly so highly, if it shrugged its shoulders and
waxed bitter over these mounting Puritans, yet it
felt in its heart that they were mounting and gave
to their personal qualities an uneasy recognition.
It, too, marked Harry Carthew for a coming man—though
it might not hold with Hawthorn that the
fact of Satan’s striking through the sorcerer’s hand
at this life marked a recognition on Satan’s part of
qualities the most dangerous to his sovereignty.
And Carthew was young, and, though yet gaunt and
pale and hardly recovered from that felon blow, of
a manly form and a well-looking face. All through
the long trial he had sat there so evidently poisoned
and suffering—urged now by his brother and now
by others to leave and take his rest, yet never going—sitting
there with his eyes upon this murdering
wizard.... The throng was ready to make him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
into the hero, the visible St. George—standing
there now with his spear lifted to give the one last,
needed blow.... There was the dragon, there! the
pale leech and all the wretches with him, and dim
and horrible behind him all his train of evil works,
and Satan horned and hoofed, spreading enormous
bat wings, making the very hall brown and dusky!
Full beside the leech, in all minds now, stood that
most vile witch Joan Heron.</p>

<p>Carthew’s words were few but explicit. “The sky
was very dark—there seemed more thunder and
lightning than there had been. I was several miles
this side of Hawthorn. I was riding without regarding
the road, my mind being on other things. My
horse stopped short, then reared. I felt the blow. It
was given by a cloaked figure that immediately
vanished.... Yes, it bore resemblance to the leech,
Gilbert Aderhold.”</p>

<p>The words fell, aimed and deliberate, like the executioner’s
flaming tow upon the straw between the
piled logs. A stillness followed as though the throng
were waiting with parted lips for the long upward
run of the flame. Then out of it came Joan’s voice,
quiet, distinct, clear, pitched loudly enough to reach
from wall to wall. “Thou liar! Know all here that
that man whom Will the smith’s son has called
the black man and saw through my window—that
man”—she stood, her arm outstretched and
her finger pointing—“that man was this man who
speaks to you! Know all here that for weary months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Master Harry Carthew had pursued and entreated
me who speak to you now—that when he turned
that afternoon upon the Hawthorn road it was
to ride to Heron’s cottage and break in upon me
there! Know that Will the smith’s son, looking
through the window, saw <i>him</i>. But he, hearing
those two knock, and fearing discovery that would
spot his fame, snatched up his cloak and made off
through another door. But he hid not far away, and
when they were gone and darkness had fallen, back
he came, stealing in at night upon a woman alone.
Know all of you here that I wanted not his love.
Know all that we struggled together, and that I
struck him in the side with a hunting-knife. Know
all that he rode from Heron’s cottage to Carthew
House, and to save himself lied as you have heard!”</p>

<p>She stood an instant longer with her arm outstretched
and her eyes upon Carthew, then slowly
turned, moved past Aderhold, and, taking her place
between Mother Spuraway and Grace Maybank,
leaned her elbow on her knee and her chin on
her hand.</p>

<p>The Witch Judge’s instantaneous thunder, the
clamour of voices, the hubbub in the hall appeared
to give her no especial concern. When silence was
obtained, and Carthew, white as death, gave a categorical
denial, she only slightly moved her shoulders,
and continued her contemplative gaze upon
this scene and much besides. That if the crowd
could have gotten at her she would most likely have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
paid with death at once for her brazen mendacity,
her measureless vile attempt to blacken one whom
the Enemy most evidently feared and hated, appeared
to trouble her neither. She sat as still as
though consciousness were elsewhere....</p>

<p>The next day it ended—the Hawthorn apostasy-sorcery-witchcraft
trial. Judgement was given,
sentence passed. The court, the crowd, the bishop,
Hawthorn, the town, all seemed well of a mind.
Death for six of the eight. For the youth who read
too much and for the boy, old Dorothy’s nephew,
pillory and imprisonment; but for the six, death.
Burning for the apostate and sorcerer, the leech
Aderhold, though, so squeamish grew the times, he
might be strangled first. For the five witches the
gallows—though it was said that the old woman
Dorothy had sickened with gaol-fever and would
not live to be hanged. The sheriff would see to it
that the execution took place within the month. In
the mean time close prison for the evil-doers, and
some thought, maybe, on how the Church and the
Law for ever overmatched the Devil.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">ESCAPE</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Joan</span> sat on the edge of her straw bed, with her arms
around her knees and her eyes upon the blank wall.
For something to do she had been plaiting straws,
making braids of many strands and laying them
beside her in squares and triangles and crosses.
That had palled, and now she was determinedly
using the inner vision. The one thing she was bent
upon was neither to think nor to feel these past days,
weeks, and months, not to think or to feel at all
closer than a year ago. She could bring back, she
could recompose, she could live again, though with
much subtle difference, where she had lived before.
She could image forth, too; she could guide a waking
dream. Now, with all the might that was in her, she
made her prison cell to grow what once as a child she
had seen, the sandy shore of the boundless sea. That
was freedom, that was light and wind and space!
Then she had raced along the beach, and in mind
she ran now, long-limbed, with flying hair, only she
turned not, came not back.... The Joan Heron
here in gaol sat motionless.... One by one she
added the other prisoners, until they all ran away by
the sea beach, all hastening with the cool wind at
their back and the free blue sky before. She drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
ahead. They were free and running to some happy
land, but their presence made it harder not to think
or feel, and so she ran ahead. Sea and sky, and harm
forgot.... One was running beside her, leaving, too,
the others. She would not image this one plainly,
but they ran and ran, the sand beneath their feet....
It never occurred to her that this <i>was</i> magic,
nor, if it had occurred, would she have cared. It was
good magic.</p>

<p>The rainbow vanished, the storm returned. Here
was the creaking, creaking of the dungeon door;
here came again the hateful gaoler, the man who had
watched her that she should not sleep! She did not
turn her head or speak; perhaps to-day he would
put down the jug of water and the crust of bread and
go without attempt at parley.</p>

<p>But he was standing waiting, his hand upon the
door which he had drawn to behind him. “Hist!” he
said; “Joan Heron!”</p>

<p>The voice was different. When she had turned
swiftly she saw that it was another man, a lean,
nervous, quaint-faced man in a stained leather jerkin.
Across the years since the huntsman’s house
and the castle wood and the castle and its servants
there shot a memory. “Gervaise!” she said: “Gervaise,
Sir Richard’s man!”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Gervaise with a jerk of his head;
“you’ve got a good memory! I hope that others’
aren’t as good! I’ve been out of these parts for the
length of two Indies voyages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened the door, put out his head and glanced
up and down the passageway, then, with a satisfied
nod, drew back, shut the door, and came close to
Joan. “But I’m Sir Richard’s man still, though not,
I would have you note, to the world—no, not to the
world!—The man who up till now locked and
unlocked this door had a dream of a purse of gold,
and so yesterday he quit the gaol’s service with a
speech to all men that he was sick halfway to death
with a shaking cold palsy! But by good fortune he
had a cousin to slip in his place. I am the cousin—for
the nonce, for the nonce! Hist, Joan; I remember
thee well at thy uncle’s there in the wood! I’ll tell
thee what I once said to him. I said, said I, ‘That
niece of thine’s got courage and wit!’—Joan, see
this bundle!” He placed it beside her upon the
straw.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Joan. “What’s in it?”</p>

<p>“Good, plain apprentice doublet, hose, cap, and
shoon! Scissors likewise to cut long hair.”</p>

<p>Joan’s hand closed upon it, but she said nothing.
She looked at him with parted lips and a light in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Just so!” said Gervaise. “It’s now close to sunset.
At nine of the clock I’ll be here again. Put
everything you have on—put your long cut hair—into
the smallest bundle you may. So, if I win you
forth as a youth, my helper—God blinding them to
the fact that I never brought you in!—they’ll find
no stitch of you to-morrow. ‘The witch—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
witch hath vanished into thin air! No other one
than Master Satan did ever help her forth!’”</p>

<p>“And when I’m forth?” said Joan.</p>

<p>“One thing at a time!” answered the new gaoler.
“A before B; bud before flower! Roads may open.
Here’s no road at all.”</p>

<p>“And that’s true,” said Joan. “But all the
others?”</p>

<p>Gervaise gazed at her with his head on one side.
“The others—the others! How do you think it
possible that I should make a complete gaol delivery?
It is not possible—not in the least possible.”</p>

<p>“Why do you choose out me? And I thank you,
Gervaise, but I think that I will not go.”</p>

<p>Gervaise looked at her with light blue eyes, not
sharp but penetrative, with a kind of basal, earth
understanding. “You listen to me, Joan, and while
you listen, just bear in mind that this is a dangerous
business! Figure some authority out there storming,
‘Where, in Cerberus’s name, is the new gaoler?’
Keep that in mind, I say, and that time’s gold—gold?—nay,
rubies and diamonds! Now, look you!
’Tis no easy jaunt, forth from this prison and town,
to some land of safety for witches and warlocks!
Naught but courage and wit and strength and good
luck by the armful will make it—and a crowd
would never make it! There are two who are not to
suffer death—but if they tried to flee and were
taken, as, of course, they most likely would be, they
would suffer it! Common sense saith, ‘Those two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
are better where they are.’ The old woman named
Dorothy died to-day. She’s gone anyhow—made
her escape clean, with Death and the scythe and
hourglass. Do you think that Mother Spuraway
could be dragged free—do you think that she could
run and lie hidden and disguise herself, and starve if
need be? For Grace Maybank—she hath pleaded
that she is with child, and is not to be hanged until
the elfling is born. Naught can be done there. And
Elspeth No-Wit sits and laughs, and the sweetest
words would not persuade her forth.” He ceased
speaking and stood with his light blue eyes upon her.</p>

<p>“There is,” said Joan, “one other.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” said Gervaise. “Well, you see mine
is the kindly feeling to youward, and Sir Richard’s
is the kindly feeling to himward. Not that Sir
Richard hath not a kindly feeling to youward likewise!
But, I know not why, he hath the greatest
liking for the sorcerer!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Joan. “And after?”</p>

<p>“In fact,” said Gervaise, “and though I would not
hurt your feelings, making you seem of less importance
to yourself, this is a rescue planned in the first
place for the sorcerer and not for the witch! But
when I am brought in—having, see you, watched
you from a nook in the crowd through the trial—I
say to Sir Richard.... More than my saying, the
sorcerer makes some such catechism as you’ve been
making, and will only have freedom on terms. So
Sir Richard nods and agrees. Double peril! But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
he will not come forth else? Then I may say that
Sir Richard, too, marked you, if for a witch, then
a brave witch, and that he hath a taste for the
quality.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that Master Aderhold escapes this
night?”</p>

<p>“‘Escapes’!—’escapes’! I know not who escapes.
It’s full of peril. But Humphrey Lantern,
who takes him bread and water, served under Sir
Richard in the wars. He’s weary of turning keys,
and hath an itch to see far countries. I know not;
Fate’s got it all hidden.—But if the stars are
propitious, you might touch another prisoner’s hand
on the dark, windy road.”</p>

<p>He stopped speaking. Joan took up the braided
straws and laid them again in patterns, then
brushed them aside. She sat with one hand in the
other, her eyes upon the wall. Then she stood up,
tall in her ragged gown. “Thank you, Gervaise! If
it goes wrong, save yourself, for no worse harm can
come to me. I’ll make ready.”</p>

<p>The sunset light dyed the town, the looping river,
the castle on the hill, the great church, and the prison
a pale red. The glow faded, night came down.
Within the prison every passageway was dim
enough; here a smoky light and there at a distance
another, and all between a wavering dusk. The new
gaoler and a youth, whom he mentioned to one they
met as his nephew and helper, pursued these passages
with a slow step and a halt here and a halt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
there, as the gaoler’s duties presented themselves....
But at last they turned a corner and saw before
them a low portal. “Win through that and we’re
outside!” muttered Gervaise. “I’ve the key—and
it would make a story, my getting it! Oiled, too.”</p>

<p>Right and left and behind them they saw no one.
He stopped. The key went in noiselessly, turned
noiselessly, the door opened outward, they felt,
instead of the heavy breath of the gaol, the air of the
wide night. They stepped into an alley, black as
pitch. Gervaise stooped, reinserted the key, and
turned it. “Lock Discovery in overnight, anyway!
Take the key and drop it in the river with your
bundle.”</p>

<p>Joan touched his arm. “There are two men standing
yonder by the wall.”</p>

<p>Gervaise nodded. “There’s hope they’re Lantern
and the other. We agreed—”</p>

<p>They crept toward the two. Hope changed to
certainty. There were some whispered words; then
in the darkness the four figures stole forward, away
from the prison walls that towered like the very
form of Death. The night was black and quiet, but
at the mouth of the alley as they left it for the wide
darkness of the square they heard voices, and staves
striking against the stones, and saw the lanterns of
the watch. The pillory was at hand; they drew into
its shadow, pressing close beneath the platform.</p>

<p>Swinging lanterns, forms ebon and tawny, footsteps,
voices, approached, seemed to envelop them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
passed, lessened in bulk toward the High Street.
The orange spheres of light dwindled to points, the
voices from frightfully hoarse and loud thinned to a
murmur afar. The four, Gervaise leading, moved
from the pillory, friendly for once, and struck across
the considerable open place. The hour was late and
the townspeople housed. They saw no one in all the
square. But as they came into the shadow of the
great church tower they again heard voices nearing
them—roistering voices of young men, petty gallants
and citizens’ sons, homeward bound from
some place of drinking and outcasts’ favours. “The
church porch,” motioned Gervaise. Like swallows
they sped across and lodged themselves in the
shadow-filled, cavernous place.</p>

<p>The roisterers came close, elected, indeed, just
here to arrest their steps and finish out a dispute.
“Black eyes are best!” averred one. “Grey eyes?
Faugh! That vilest Hawthorn witch hath grey eyes!
Ha, ha! Eyes like Joan Heron!”</p>

<p>“That she hath not! They are green. A grey eye is
well enough! That vile witch’s are green.”</p>

<p>“Grey.”</p>

<p>“I tell thee I saw them, green and wicked! Green
beneath red gold hair.”</p>

<p>“Grey! Grey as the sea, and hair like wheat when
it is cut.”</p>

<p>“Thou fool—”</p>

<p>“Thou knave—”</p>

<p>“Thou villain to liken my mistress’s eye to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
a vile witch and devil’s whore! My sword shall make
thee eat it—”</p>

<p>“Will it? Will it? Out, tuck—”</p>

<p>But a third and fourth, wiser or less flushed with
wine, struck between. “Will you have the watch
upon us and be clapped up for whether a vile witch’s
eyes are grey or green? Grey or green or blue or
black or brown, ere the month be gone the crows
will pick them out! Put up your blades!—I told
you so! The watch—”</p>

<p>True it was that the watch was coming back. The
roisterers fell suddenly into hushed and amicable
converse, began to move, too, from before the
church. But the watch were coming hastily, were
already within eyeshot of the porch. It was not so
dark now, either.</p>

<p>“The moon is up,” muttered Gervaise. “We
should have been clear of the town—”</p>

<p>It was rising, indeed, above the housetops. The
watch and the young men were in parley, fifty yards
away. The four from the prison pressed more closely
into the shadow of the pillars. They stood in blackness
and watched the full round moon silver the
houses and the uneven floor of the square. The
moonbeams touched the portal, picked out the carven
figures that adorned it. Watch and the explanatory
tavern group, voices and glowworm lanterns
moved farther, lessened into distance, disappeared
in the dark mouth of some street. Windows had
been opened, householders were looking forth. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
needed to wait until all was again peace and sleeping
time.</p>

<p>Aderhold spoke for the first time since the four
had left the prison alley. The apprentice youth
stood near him. They leaned against the one pillar,
and though they thought not of it, they had among
other seemings, in the lapping light and darkness,
the seeming of two bound to one stake. He spoke in
a whisper. “You are not afraid?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I knew that you would not be. Little worse can
come, and something that is better may.”</p>

<p>“Yes.... I had rather sink trying.”</p>

<p>The moon whitened the carvings of the porch.
Grotesque after grotesque came into the light: the
man with the head of a wolf, the woman with a bat
spreading its wings across her eyes, the demons, the
damned, the beatified exulting over the damned, fox
and goat and ape crossed with man and woman.
The silver, calm light turned all from black to grey.
The wind whispered, the nearer stars shone, the
moon travelled her ancient road and threw transformed
sunlight upon the earth. The minutes passed,
the town lay fast asleep.</p>

<p>Gervaise moved from the porch, the others followed.
They would not pass through the town; they
took a steep street which led them first down to the
river, and then, as steeply mounting, up to the castle
wood. They went in silence, with a rapid step, and
came without mishap under the shadow of the summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
trees. Here was a wall which they climbed,
dropping from its top into fern and brush. Joan
knew the path that they took, a skirting path,
walled with bracken, arched over by oak boughs.
They heard wild things moving, but no human
tongue questioned them. It was cool and dim, and
because the moon was riding high and they must
make all haste, they ran along this path which
stretched a mile and more. Gervaise was light and
spare as a jester; the wry-mouthed, surly, one-time
soldier strong enough, though somewhat rusty in the
joints; Aderhold was a thinker who lived much out
of doors, a leech who walked to his patients, and
where there was need walked fast; Joan, a woman of
Arcady, with a step as light as a panther’s. These
two had behind them prison inaction and weakening,
prison fare, anxiety, despair, strain, and torment.
They were not in health and strength as they
had been. But instinct furnished a mighty spur; if
they must run to live, they would run! They ran in
the scented darkness, the bracken brushing their
arms, the moon sending against them, between the
oak boughs, a silver flight of hurtless arrows. The
mile was overpast, the path widened into a moonlit
vale, the vale swept downward to a fringing cliff,
by day not formidable, but difficult in this gliding,
watery light. The four, with some risk of broken
limbs, swung themselves down by jutting root and
stone, dropped at last a sheer twelve feet, and found
themselves clear of the wood and the castle heights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
clear of the town, out upon the grassy edge of the
London road. It stretched before them, gleaming,
bare, silent as to the feet which even now might be
coming after them, silent as to whether or no they
would outstrip those feet, silent as to the ends that it
would serve. They lay for a minute upon the bank,
breathing hard, regathering force. An owl hooted,
<i>Tu-whoo! Tu-whoo!</i> They rose from the wayside
growth and took the road. It ran so hard and gleaming—it
might be a friend, it might be an enemy!
Over them soared the night, far off they saw sleeping
houses. The air was astir, the shadows of the trees
dancing on the road.</p>

<p>They measured a mile, two miles. The road
climbed somewhat; before them, in the flooding
moonlight, they saw a gibbet with its arm and down-hanging
chains.</p>

<p>“I know this place,” said Aderhold.</p>

<p>The wry-mouthed man wagged his head. “Creak,
creak! Once I saw fifty such in a lane, and the air was
black with birds! This one’s stood clean for a year.”</p>

<p>It was like a letter against the sky. Joan stared at
it. Her lips parted. “I would cut it down and set
fire to it, and warm some beggar and her child.”</p>

<p>Gervaise was looking about him. “The crossroads
are not far from here. He said—”</p>

<p>“Stand still. There’s a horseman there.”</p>

<p>Gervaise nodded his head and continued to move
forward. The horseman moved from the lane mouth
into the road. Even before Gervaise turned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
beckoned, Aderhold saw who it was. “The man
with the hawk,” he said, and smiled.</p>

<p>The man of the hawk and of the silver box dismounted,
threw the reins over his horse’s neck, and
stepped forward to meet them. Road and lane and
fields, the heap of rock amid fox-gloves where Aderhold
had sat one summer afternoon, the knoll
crowned by the gibbet—all lay bare of human life,
whitened by the moon.</p>

<p>“Ha, philosopher!” said Sir Richard. “Places
called of ill omen are often just the other way
round! Well met again, under a harmless tree!” He
put out his hand.</p>

<p>Aderhold clasped it. “Poor enough to say, ‘I
thank you, friend!’ And yet enough when it is the
very truth. I thank you, friend!”</p>

<p>He spoke to Joan. “This is the man who opened
our prison doors.”</p>

<p>She came and stood beside him. “I thank you,
sir. May you be through all time a friend to folk and
find them friends to you!”</p>

<p>She stood tall and straight in man’s dress. She
had cut away the lengths of hair. A man’s cap
rested upon the short, thick locks. At first she made
no motion to remove this cap; instead, as she faced
Sir Richard, she made, involuntarily, the bend of
knee that formed a curtsy; then, as instantly, she
caught herself, recovered her height, and lifting her
hand doffed the cap, and stood with it held against
her breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>The man from the castle gave a genial laugh.
There was admiration in the sound. “Quick to
learn! A flexible free mind—and courage! Good
youth, I seem to remember you at the old huntsman’s
house.”</p>

<p>“At times my father wrote for you, please you,
Sir Richard. And twice or thrice you came and sat
in the porch and talked with him and my uncle.
And once it was cherry time, and I brought you a
dish of cherries.”</p>

<p>“I remember! And then you both went away.”
His kindly look dwelled upon her. “I watched you
through that five-days’ comedy in the Judgement
Hall yonder. I found it worth my mind’s while to
watch you; no less worth it than to watch this other
that they called servant of Evil! As for thanks,
it is yet to be seen if there is much reason.” He
spoke to them both. “I am putting you on the
road to the nearest port, and when you reach it
I can bring you to a ship there. But before you
reach it, you may be taken, and if you reach it and
enter the ship, I cannot answer for what will come to
you afterwards in life. I may be no friend at all.”</p>

<p>“Friend, whatever comes,” said Aderhold. “If
we die to-morrow, friend on the other side of that.”</p>

<p>“We’ll touch hands on that,” answered Sir
Richard. “And now, seeing that you must go on to
the crossroads, I will speak while we walk.”</p>

<p>They put themselves into motion, five human
figures now upon the road, and the horse following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
his master. The two escaped prisoners and their
helper moved ahead; behind them came Gervaise
and the gaoler, discoursing in whispers. The moon
shone down, the wind took a harp-like tone.</p>

<p>“At the crossroads you four—Humphrey Lantern,
that was a good man-at-arms in the Low
Countries, and Gervaise, a born wanderer and a man
of mine between long flittings, and one Giles Allen,
a chirurgeon, and John his brother—will take the
road that runs to the port. If you reach it or reach it
not, one wiser than I may tell! Gervaise knows a
place where you may lie hidden to-morrow, going on
at nightfall. You may or may not save yourselves.
On the way thither I can give you but my wishes.
But when you come to the port,—if you come to
the port,—go at once to the harbour and find out
the Silver Queen.” He gave a packet wrapped in silk
to Aderhold. “Give the letter therein to the captain.
There is also a purse.—Nay, the thing must be
done rightly!”</p>

<p>“The Silver Queen.”</p>

<p>“The Silver Queen, sailing to Virginia. I have a
venture in her, and the captain owes me somewhat.
She carries a Virginia lading of adventurers and indentured
men.—In Virginia are forests and savage
men and wild beasts, but less preoccupation, maybe,
with Exclusive Salvation and the Guilt of Doubt—though
even in Virginia a still tongue were certainly
best!—To Virginia is the only help that I can give.”</p>

<p>“I am content,” said Aderhold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The man of the hawk looked at Joan.</p>

<p>“I am content,” she said.</p>

<p>“Good!” said Sir Richard. “Humphrey Lantern
is all for adventure and a new world. But Gervaise,
when he has seen you safely shipped, will manage to
cross to Ireland and take service for a time with my
brother there. Next year I’m for France, and I look
to find Gervaise dropped like an acorn on the road
to Paris. But Lantern goes with you. What, good
Humphrey, is now your name?”</p>

<p>The red-faced, wry-mouthed man scratched his
head. “I hadn’t thought, Your Honour.... George
is a good name—George Dragon, Sir Richard.”</p>

<p>The little company fell silent, walking in the
moonlight upon a road bare as a sword.... Behind
Joan and Aderhold receded the old life, sunk away
the town, the road to Hawthorn and Hawthorn and
its church, the Oak Grange and Hawthorn Forest,
people a many, the two Carthews, Master Thomas
Clement, Alison, Cecily, other names, folk a many,
things done and suffered, old life. Before them
stretched something new, strange life, bare as yet
of feature as the road before them. Their imaginations
were not busy with it; they left it veiled, but
yet they felt its presence.... Undoubtedly, even at
this moment, even earlier than this moment, their
escape might be discovered. Already the hue and
cry might be raised. Even now the finders might be
on their track. They might be seized long ere they
could reach the port, or, having reached it, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
they could reach the Silver Queen. The Silver
Queen might be searched before it sailed. They
might be dragged back. The gallows and the stake
might be cheated no moment of their prey. They
might again see Hawthorn faces. They knew all
this, but their thought did not dwell upon it. Their
minds saw dimly something new, bare yet of feature.</p>

<p>The man of the hawk walked musing beside Aderhold.
At last he spoke. “We are not far from the
crossroads. When we are there you will go your
ways and I shall turn and go back to the castle....
If we grow by means of all circumstance as it flows
by and through us, how are you changed by what
has lately passed?”</p>

<p>“This summer,” said Aderhold, “I grew somewhat
past bodily fear. I should like you to know that.”</p>

<p>“I saw no great cowardice before.... How now
do you feel toward your fellow man?”</p>

<p>“My fellow man is myself.”</p>

<p>“And toward that which we call God?”</p>

<p>“As I did.... I seek that which is high within me.”</p>

<p>The other nodded. “I understand....” They
walked on in silence until they saw before them the
crossroads. Aderhold remembered the ragged trees,
the dyke-like bank, the stake through the heart of
the suicide. The night was wearing late. The moon
shone small and high. Charles’s Wain was under the
North Star. The five came to a stand, and here the
four said good-bye to the one.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ROAD TO THE PORT</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Their</span> side of the earth turned, turned with ceaseless
motion toward the central orb. There grew a
sense of the threshold of dawn, of the chill and sunken
furthest hour, when the need was great for the
door of light to open. The road they were upon was
narrower, rougher, than the highway, with more hills
to climb. The four travelled as rapidly as was possible,
there being a goal to be reached before sunlight
and the world abroad. Gervaise and Lantern
swung on without overmuch effort, but the faces of
Joan and Aderhold were drawn and the beads stood
on their foreheads. Behind them were long prison,
scanty fare, bodily hurt, broken strength. Their
lips parted, their breath came gaspingly. They went
on from moment to moment, each step now a weariness,
all thought suspended, the whole being bent
only on endurance, on measuring the road that must
be measured. They did not speak, though now and
then one turned eyes to the other.</p>

<p>Far off a cock crew and was answered by another.
Vaguely the air changed, the world paled, a
steely light came into the east. Gervaise looked at
the two. “We’ll rest here until there’s colour in
the sky. We’ve come pretty fast.” There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
great stone by the road. Aderhold and Joan sank
upon it, lay outstretched, still as in the last sleep.
He had a wide cloak, she had none. He raised
himself upon his hand and spread over her the half
of this. They lay with closed eyes, drinking rest.</p>

<p>Far off and not so far, more cocks were crowing.
In the eastern sky the bars of grey turned purple,
then into them came a faint red. The birds were
cheeping in the tree-tops. The mist veil over field
and meadow grew visible. Gervaise and Lantern,
who had been seated with their knees drawn up,
arms upon knees and head upon arms, raised their
eyes, marked the red in the sky, and got to their feet.
Gervaise went and touched the two. “Time to go
on! We’ve got to get hidden before Curiosity’s had
breakfast.”</p>

<p>They went on, the light strengthening, the air
warming, a myriad small sounds beginning. In less
than a mile they came to a branching road, rough
and narrow. Gervaise leading, they entered this,
followed it for some distance, and left it for a half-obliterated
cart track running through woods.
In turn they quitted the woods for a stubblefield,
plunged from this into a sunken lane, and so in the
early sunlight came before a small farmhouse, remote
and lonely, couched and hidden between
wooded hills. “My granther’s brother’s house,”
said Gervaise. “Stay you all here while I go spy out
the land.” They waited in the sunken lane, the blue
sky overhead. The wry-mouthed man busied himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
with a torn shoe. Joan and Aderhold knelt in a
warm hollow of the bank, leaned against the good
earth.</p>

<p>“<i>Giles and John Allen</i>,” he said. “Do not forget
the names.”</p>

<p>“No.... When I speak to you, am I to say,
‘Giles’?”</p>

<p>“Aye,—aye, John.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they will not know that I am a
woman?”</p>

<p>He looked at her critically for the first time. “You
have height and a right frame. Your voice is deeper
than most women’s. Now that your hair is cut, I
have seen youths with locks so worn and of that
colour and thickness. You are pale from prison and
unhappiness, but the sun will tan your cheeks. You
have mind and will, and all that you do you do with
a just art. Discovery may come, but it need not
come—”</p>

<p>Gervaise reappeared. “It’s all right! The old
people will not blab, and their two daughters and
the ploughman have propitiously gone to a fair!
Now, Master Allen, and your brother, and good
George Dragon—” They moved toward the house.
Gervaise jerked his thumb toward a barn that
showed beyond. “Good straw—good, warm, dusk
corner to lie <i>perdu</i> in, back of the eaves! I’ll bring
food, bread and milk. So you’ll have your rest to-day,
and to-night we’ll cover as many miles as may
be.—This way! We’ll not go through the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Say we’re taken, I’d rather not drag the good folk
in more than ankle-deep.”</p>

<p>The barn was dim and wholesome-smelling. The
piled straw in the loft felt good beneath aching
frames. They made with bundles of it a chance-seeming
barrier, behind which in a fragrant hollow
they prepared to rest. Close overhead was the
brown roof that, beyond their niche, sloped steeply
upward a great distance. A square had been cut for
light and air; through it poured vagrant, scented
breezes, and in and out flew the swallows. The light
was thick and brown; it would take keen eyes to see
aught but straw, rudely heaped. Gervaise brought a
basket filled with homely, country fare, and then a
great jug of spring water. They ate and drank, and
then set watches—one to watch while the others
slept. Humphrey Lantern took the first.</p>

<p>Rest was sweet, sleep was sweet.... Joan woke
sometime in the early afternoon. There in a hollow of
his own sat Gervaise, succeeded to Lantern’s watch.
He sat, blue-eyed and meditative, chewing a straw.
Lantern sprawled at a little distance, in sleep back,
perhaps, in the old wars. Nearer lay Aderhold, his
arm thrown across his eyes, profoundly sleeping. At
first Joan was bewildered and did not know where
she was; then the whole surged back. She lay quite
still, and memory painted for her picture after
picture.</p>

<p>Presently Gervaise, glancing her way, saw that her
eyes were open. He nodded to her and crept over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the straw until they were close neighbours, when he
seated himself Turk fashion and asked if she had
slept.</p>

<p>She laughed. “Unless I was dead, I was asleep.”</p>

<p>“He has not moved. Prison life’s a hard life, and
then I understand that before that he was up day
and night with the plague.... Well, and what do
you think of the wide world before you?”</p>

<p>“Is it so wide?”</p>

<p>“That’s as you take it. It’s as wide as your vision,
your taste, and your hearing.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to be hanged.... It used to come
and gather round me when I slept, there in the dungeon,
in the prison. First the place grew large, and
then it filled with people,—I could feel them in the
dark,—and then I knew where the gallows was,
and hands that burned me and bruised me put a
rope around my neck, and in the dark the people
began to laugh and curse. And then I woke up, and
my hands and arms were cold and wet, and I said,
‘So it will be, and so the rope will feel, and so they
will laugh!’... Over and over.... But it did not
come to me here, though I was asleep. I do not believe
that they will take us now.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in witches and black men and
Satan and his country?”</p>

<p>“I used to. Isn’t every little child taught it? It’s
hard to rub out what they taught you when you
were a child. But do I believe it now?” She
laughed with a bitter mirth. “My oath, on anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
you please, that I do not believe it now! I believe
that some folk have more good than bad in them,
and a few have far more good than bad. And that
some folk have more bad than good in them, and a
few have far more bad than good. And that most
folk are pretty evenly mixed, and that now one having
walks forth and now another. But that we are
all folk.”</p>

<p>“That presents well enough,” said Gervaise, “my
manner of thinking. But then I have lived long
with Sir Richard.”</p>

<p>They fell silent. A bird flew in at the window.
The pleasant, drowsy scent of the hay was about
them, the sun-shot dusk, the murmur of the wind
across the opening. “Is your watch nearly over,”
asked Joan, “and were you going to wake him next?
I am awake already, so give it to me.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” said Gervaise; “neither to you nor to
him! I’ll sit here for another two hours and think of
the flowers I might have grown. Then Lantern will
take it again. You two are to get your rest.—I like
well enough to converse with you, but my advice is
to shut your eyes and go back to sleep.”</p>

<p>Joan smiled at him and obeyed. She shut her grey
eyes, and in two minutes was back at the fountain
of rest for overwrought folk. She slept, slept, and
Aderhold slept. When they waked the sun was
hanging low in the west. They waked at a touch
from Gervaise. “Best all of us open our eyes and
pull our senses together! I hear the two daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and the ploughman, and maybe company with
them, coming back from the fair.”</p>

<p>There were heard, indeed, from the lane, not far
away, voices talking freely and all together. Lantern
crept to the window and with care looked forth.
He came back. “Country folk—five or six, and
merry from the fair.” The voices reached the farmhouse,
entered it, and became muffled. The sun
dropped behind the hills.</p>

<p>Twilight was not far advanced when there
sounded a footstep in the barn below the hayloft.
The four, still before, now lay hardly breathing.</p>

<p>The footstep approached the loft, halted beside
the ladder that led up. “Gervaise” said a quavering,
anxious voice. “Granther’s brother,” murmured
Gervaise, and crept cautiously to the edge of
the loft. Presently he disappeared down the ladder,
and the three, crouched where the roof was lowest,
heard a muted colloquy below. The farmer’s voice
sounded alarmed and querulous, Gervaise’s soothing.
At last they ceased to talk, and the old man’s slow
and discontented step was heard to leave the barn.
Gervaise came up the ladder and crawled over the
straw to the escaped prisoners and runaway gaoler.
The loft was now in darkness, only the square window
glimmered yet, framing a sky from which the
gold had not quite faded.</p>

<p>“It’s boot and saddle, sound horn and away!” he
said in a sober whisper. “We had not been gone two
hours when some officious fool must seek the heart’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
ease of Lantern’s company! No Lantern to be found—all
dark! No new turnkey to be found either.
Whereupon they waken an authority, and he’s
inspired to open dungeon doors and look within!
Hue and cry! Town first, but with the morning light
men a-horseback on all roads.—They had it all at
the fair—brought it all home. County’s afire to
bring the wild beasts back. Country for as many
miles as necessary will be scoured clean as a prize
pannikin. Reward for capture, living or dead;—bands
out to earn it. All manner penalties for any
who harbour. The goodman here put two and two
together,—matched four with four,—and at the
first chance, while they’re all at supper, comes shivering
out to warn us off. Granther’s brother’ll not
tell, but travel it is!—Humphrey Lantern, you take
the basket with what food’s left. We’ll need it.
Toss the straw together so ’twill not show the lair.
We’ll just wait till that last light goes.”</p>

<p>They waited, felt their way to the ladder and
down it, then out of the barn. Voices were noisy in
the house a stone’s throw away. A woman came to
the open door and stood looking out. When she had
turned away, they entered the lane and followed it
until it set them in the wood track they had left in
the morning. Here they paused to consider their
course. In that direction so many miles, as the crow
flew, lay the port. Return to the road they had
left at dawn, strive to keep upon it at least through
the night, and so make certainly the greatest speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
toward their goal? Night-time, and ordinarily there
would be none or little travel through the night, and
that little easily hidden from. But to-night the road
might be most perilous; harrow and rake might be
dragging along it. Nevertheless they decided for the
road.</p>

<p>It was now utterly dark. They saw nothing,
heard nothing, but the small continuous voice of the
hot, dry night. They were rested; to Joan and Aderhold
especially there seemed to have come anew
youth and strength. They walked steadily, with a
swinging step, and the country fell behind them and
the sea grew nearer. They spoke only at long intervals
and then in whispers.</p>

<p>“Luck’s with us,” offered Gervaise. “I’d almost
rather see it more chequered! Very Smooth always
has a mocking look in her eyes.”</p>

<p>Lantern growled in his throat. “I haven’t had
much smooth in <i>my</i> life. It owes me a little smooth.”</p>

<p>The moon rose. It showed them on either hand a
rolling country, and before them a village. The road
ran through this; therefore, for the time being, they
would leave the road. They crept through a hedge
and found themselves in a rough and broken field.
Crossing this they pierced a small wood and dipped
down to a stream murmuring past a mill. The great
wheel rose before them, the moon making pearls of
the dripping water. The stream had a footbridge.
They hesitated, but all was dark and silent. They
crossed, and as they stepped upon the beaten earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
on the farther side, two dogs sprang upon them from
the shadow of the mill. They came barking furiously—the
refugees snatched what stick or stone they
could reach and beat them back. One was cowardly
and stood off and barked, but the other, a great
black beast, sprang upon the first in his path. It
chanced to be Joan. She caught him by his own
throat before he could reach hers, but he was fierce
and strong and tore from her grasp. His teeth met
in the cloth of her jerkin, he dragged her to the
ground. Aderhold’s hands were at his throat, choking
his jaws open, pushing him backward. Over the
physician’s bent shoulder Lantern’s arm rose and
fell, the moon making the dagger gleam. The dog
loosened his grip, howled, and gave back with a
slashed and bleeding muzzle.</p>

<p>Out of a hut, built beside the mill, came a man’s
voice, roughly threatening. “Who’s there? Who’s
there? Ill-meaning folk take warning!”</p>

<p>As they did not answer, the owner of the voice
burst from the hut and came toward them, shouting
to the dogs to hold fast and swinging a great thorn
stick. The moon showed a half-dressed, stout rustic,
bold enough but dull of wit, and still heavy,
besides, with sleep. Behind him came a half-grown
boy.</p>

<p>“Call off your dogs!” cried Gervaise. “We are
seamen ashore, making from the port to the town of
——. They told us there was a village hereabouts,
and we kept on walking after night, thinking to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to it. But we think it’s bewitched and walks as we
walk. Call your dogs off! We’re harmless men, used
to the sea and crossing a strange country. Put us
right, friend, and thank you kindly!”</p>

<p>“What have you done to Holdfast? He’s frighted
and bleeding.”</p>

<p>“He pulled one of us down and nothing else
served to make him loosen grip. ’Twill heal and no
harm done!”</p>

<p>But a controversy gathered in the eyes of the miller’s
man. “That dog’s worth all the ’gyptians and
vagrants and seamen between here and London
town! If you think you’re going round murdering
dogs—”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Gervaise, “that I’ve in my pouch
a crown piece which I got of a gentleman for a parrokeet
and an Indian pipe. Let’s see if ’t won’t salve
that muzzle.” He drew it forth and turned it to and
fro in the moonlight. “Ask the dog. Hark’ee! He
says, ‘Take it, and let harmless sailor folk pass!’”
He slid it into the peasant’s hand, who stood looking
down upon it with a dawning grin. “Cross this
bridge,” asked Gervaise, “and we’ll be in the path
to the village?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” answered the fellow. “If you be
harmful folk, let them find it out there!—Be you
sure this piece is good? You ben’t coiners or
passers?”</p>

<p>“We ben’t,” said Gervaise. “The piece is as good
as the new breeches it will buy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>They recrossed the bridge, stepping from it into
the wood already traversed. The boy’s shrill voice
came to them from across the stream. “Father,
father! They’re four, and ’twas four the man told
us broke gaol! They ben’t sailors—they be the
witches!” His voice took a bewildered tone. “Only
one of them was a woman—and they’re going toward
the town—”</p>

<p>“What I be going to do,” answered the man, “is to
go up t’ the house and waken miller—”</p>

<p>The dogs were still barking. The boy’s voice
rose shriller and shriller. “I know they’re witches!
They had glowing eyes and they were taller than
people—”</p>

<p>The four plunged more deeply into the wood. The
confused sound died behind them. They went up
the stream a mile, came upon a track that ran down
to stepping-stones, crossed the water for the second
time, and once more faced seaward; then after a
time turned at right angles and so struck the road
again, the village well passed. But the détour had
cost them heavily in time. Moreover, even in the
night-time, there grew a feeling of folk aware, of
movement, a fear of eyes, of a sudden shout of arrest....
They heard behind them a trampling of horses’
hoofs, together with voices. There was just time to
break into a friendly thicket by the roadside, and
crouch there among the hazel stems, out of the
moonlight. There came by a party of men, some
a-horseback, some on foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“Four,” said one distinctly.</p>

<p>“Shall we beat that thicket?”</p>

<p>“They couldn’t have gotten this far.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ride through it to make sure—”</p>

<p>Man and horse came into the thicket. They
passed within ten feet of the four lying flat, but
touched them not and saw them not.... When all
were gone the sorcerer and the witch and their companions
came forth and again pressed seaward. The
dawn appeared, the sky unearthly cold and remote
behind the clean black line of the earth. It showed
a homeless country for them. With the first grey
gleam there began a traffic upon the road. They
were passed in the dimness by a pedlar with his
pack, a drover with sheep. They saw coming a
string of carts, and they left the road again, this
time for good. They lay now amid heather upon a
moor, and in the pale, uncertain light considered
their course. The miles were not many now before
them, but they were dangerous miles. They decided
at last to break company and, two and two, to strive
for the port. Say that, so they arrived there, then
would they come as well to an inner ring of dangers....
But they all strove for cheer, or grim or bright,
and Gervaise appointed for rendezvous an obscure
small inn called The Moon, down by the harbour’s
edge. It was kept by a man known to Sir Richard.
Get to The Moon, whisper a word or two which
Gervaise now furnished, and the rest would probably
go well. The problem was to get there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>It was also to decide, if they divided, who would
go with whom. Gervaise looked at Aderhold. “Will
you, sir, take Humphrey Lantern, and Joan go with
me?” There was a silence, then Aderhold spoke,
“You have proved yourself the best of guides and
guards. But life has taught me, too, to watch for
dangers and in some measure has given me skill.
And she and I are the heinous ones and the desperate.”
He turned his eyes to Joan. “Shall we not
keep together?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “Very good.... The sky is growing
red.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FARTHER ROAD</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">What</span> were Gervaise’s and Lantern’s adventures
they would hear when they reached The Moon.
Their own, throughout this day, led them to no
harm. They had been for long in the hand of Ill
Fortune; it seemed now that she slept and her grasp
relaxed. The first outward happening came quickly,
ere the sun was an hour high. They were crossing
a heath-like, shelterless expanse, when a sudden
<i>Hilloa!</i> halted them. Two men were rapidly approaching
over the heath.</p>

<p>“If we can, we will evade them,” said Aderhold.
“If we cannot and they would keep us by force—?”</p>

<p>“They are not wrestlers nor giants,” answered
Joan. “If they have no weapon, mayhap we can
give them as good as they send—”</p>

<p>The two ran up, looked at them suspiciously.
“What do you here? Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Nay, who are <i>you</i>?” said Aderhold. “We are
lookers for a reward.”</p>

<p>The opposing pairs stood and eyed each other.
The newcomers were two lank and unhealthy-looking,
plainly dressed, town-appearing young men.</p>

<p>“Fie!” said one. “We also search, but not for love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
of lucre and silver pounds in purses! We would
serve God by stamping his foes into dust!”</p>

<p>“Which way have you looked?”</p>

<p>The more garrulous of the two swept his arm
around. “Unless the Prince of the Power of the Air
hath held them invisible to the eyes of the Elect,
they are not in that direction nor in that! My
companion, Only Truth Turner, and I were about
to seek in the quarter to which I see you are addressed.
Let us, then, seek for a while in company.
And what, friends, may be your names?”</p>

<p>“I am Relative Truth Allen, otherwise known as
Giles Allen, and this is my brother, Be-ye-kind-to-one-Another.—Four
together, is it not so? Three
fierce, foreign-looking men, and a short, dark woman.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t,” said Only Truth, “hear them described.
But there will assuredly be some devil’s
mark whereby to know them.”</p>

<p>They were now moving together over the heath.
Each of the four had a stout stick, broken at some
time in their several journeyings. With theirs the
two townsmen now and again beat some clump of
furze or thorn. Once a hare rushed forth and away,
and once a lark spread its wings and soaring vanished
into the blue. “Do you think,” said the
speaker, whose name was Wrath Diverted, “do you
think that that hare and bird might have been—?
I understand that in the trial the Hawthorn witches
all avowed that they became bird or beast at will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Aderhold followed the lark with his eyes. “I have
seen human beings who reminded me of bird or
beast, and I have seen bird and beast who reminded
me of human beings. If that one up yonder is a
witch, she hath strength of wing!”</p>

<p>The lark disappeared; the hare came not back.
“Even so,” said Only Truth, “there would be two
left. But I hold that those were natural creatures.”</p>

<p>They walked through the bright morning, over
the high bare world. “We came out,” said Wrath
Diverted, “to see my brother Another-Pays-my-Debt
who dwells at Win-Grace Farm. Yesterday
came news of the loosing of Beelzebub. Whereupon
many made themselves into bands and went forth
even as hunters, and at dawn this morning Only
Truth and I also.”</p>

<p>“Let us keep our faces seaward,” said Aderhold.
“You have looked that way and we have looked
this.”</p>

<p>“Good,” answered Wrath Diverted; “but we
should examine that dip in the earth I see yonder.”</p>

<p>They searched the hollow and found naught to the
purpose, which done, they went briskly on, but kept
a constant watch to right and left. “This heath,”
said Wrath Diverted, “will presently fall to tilled
lands with roads and dwellings, byways and hedges.
Then there will be places to search, but here there is
naught—Were you at the trial of the troublers of
Israel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke to Joan. “No,” she answered. “We
heard of it. Everybody heard of it.”</p>

<p>“For my part,” said Only Truth, “I cannot conceive
how a man when he hath choice of masters
should choose so scurvy an one! Here is a King
whom you may serve who, if in this world He
seemeth at times neglectful of his servants and niggardly
in comforts and rewards, yet, when you have
come to the next world which is his true city and
court, you have his sign manual for it that you will
have honours and titles and riches without end!
Moreover, your body will be happy and comforted,
and you will not again be sorrowful or tried, nor ever
have to work, but only stand and praise.—Not so
with that other man, who will not kneel here nor
wear this Master’s livery! Comes King Satan and
claps him, ‘You are mine!’ Then mayhap he is led
to a dance of unlawful and honey-sweet pleasures, or
is given a heap of gold, or is dressed in a purple
mantle and given a sceptre to hold, or is made drunk
with worthless knowledge! But it is all a show and
turneth to gall and wormwood. For incontinent he
dieth. Nay, oftenest there is not in his hire the
honey-sweet nor the gold and purple! For the other
King’s servant even here triumpheth, and Satan’s
man dieth a lazar and poor, even if he be not hanged,
torn asunder, broken on the wheel, or burned. Then
goeth the wicked wretch to his Master’s capital and
court, even as the good man goeth to his. But the
one servant lifteth his feet in haste from burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
marl and findeth no cool floor to set them on. He
swalloweth smoke and flames and findeth no water
in all hell. His flesh blackeneth to a crisp, but is
never burned senseless. A million years pass, and
not one second but he hath felt first pain and terror.
Eternity, eternity! and never will his anguish lessen.
He looketh about him and seeth those for whom he
had affection—for like liketh like—burning with
him, and about their feet, creeping and wailing, the
unbaptized babes. He looketh up, and he seeth
across the gulf the other King’s court, and the
Happy Servant. And the Happy Servant looketh
down and seeth him, and his own bliss waxeth great.
Wherefore—”</p>

<p>Wrath Diverted took the word. “Nay! You err,
Brother Only Truth, in using the word ‘choice.’
There is no choice, none!—that is, none on our
part. Attribute no merit to us who attain Salvation!
Attain it, do I say? Nay, we attain it not,
we are <i>lifted</i> into it. Another pays my debt!”</p>

<p>“Nay, I meant it in that wise,” said Only Truth.
“A babe in the faith knoweth that all are rightly
lost and damned. Lost, lost! all are lost. Five thousand
and more years ago it happened! One day, nay,
one hour, one minute—and all was done and over!
Then all souls sank to hell, and all put on Satan’s
livery. In hell are folk who have burned and howled
five thousand years! Lost, lost, all are lost! But the
King, because of the Prince’s intercession, holds out
his sceptre to those among us whom he chooses out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
But we have no goodness or merit of our own! Miserable
sinners are we all, and the due of perdition!”</p>

<p>“Precisely so,” said Wrath Diverted. “In
Adam’s fall, we sinned all. Wherefore they in hell,
whether they be pagan or heathen or ignorant or
babes, have no reason to complain. But while all
are guilty there be some who have added rebellion to
rebellion, and sewed the web of disobedience with
the needle of blasphemy! They be those who refuse
to worship! They be those who will not admire the
Plan of Salvation!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Only Truth. “Apostates, Sadducees,
atheists, miscreants, infidels, unbelievers, witches,
warlocks, wizards, magicians, and sorcerers!
Damned and lost! They howl in the hottest cauldron
and burn in a furnace seven times heated!”</p>

<p>So discoursing they came insensibly into a strip of
country, green and pleasant with late summer. Before
them was a hillside with a parcel of children at
play, a dozen or more, and among them a big boy or
two. These now gathered into a knot and stared
down at the pedestrians. “Four—coming across
Blackman’s Heath!”</p>

<p>There arose a buzzing sound, half from fright, half
from a sense of exciting adventure. One bolder
than his fellows called down. “Be you the witches?”</p>

<p>“Witches!—witches—!”</p>

<p>“They be all men—”</p>

<p>“Ho! Satan could make them all seem men!
They pray to Satan and he lets them turn what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
will. Bats and red mice and ravens and horses—”</p>

<p>“So he could! Witches!”</p>

<p>“They be four, and they come running over
Blackman’s Heath—”</p>

<p>A stone leaped down the hillside. Another followed,
and struck Only Truth, who grew red and
angry and brandished his stick. The assailants
shouted, half in fear, half in glee, and gave somewhat
back; then seeing that they were safe, well above the
assailed and with the open hill behind them, stopped
and threw more stones. Only Truth would have
made after them, up the hillside, but Aderhold
checked him. “Do not fight bees and children—”</p>

<p>They were presently out of stoneshot. But the
children might carry news and set others on their
path. “Those escaped are four,” said Aderhold to
Wrath Diverted, “and we are four. It will not be
convenient to be stopped and questioned on that
ground.”</p>

<p>“I believe that you are right,” answered Wrath
Diverted. “Moreover, you and your brother are
evidently country-bred, and walk more swiftly than
is comfortable for us who dwell in towns. Let us
part, therefore in amity. I see yonder a road which
should furnish easier walking than this growth and
unevenness beneath our feet.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Aderhold, “we, being as you say,
country-bred, will keep on seaward over these fields
and downs.”</p>

<p>An hour later the two lay in a pit dug long since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
for some purpose and now half filled with old dead
brush, while a formidable chase went by. These
were mounted men, officers of the law, armed
with an accurate description, among them, indeed, a
sheriff’s man who knew the escaped by sight. They
came trampling by; they looked down into the pit as
they passed, and thought they saw true bottom and
naught there but a litter of dead leaves and twigs;
they checked their horses not many yards from the
opening and stood conferring. Their voices came
down in an indistinguishable hoarse murmur like the
sea against the strand. They shook their bridles and
rode away.... The two, who had lain half-stifled,
covered by the bed of brush, stirred, heaved the
stuff away, rose gasping to their knees. Silence and
the blue sky. They crouched, eye above the rim of
the pit, until sight gave reassurance, then climbed
forth and brushed from each other dead leaf and
ancient dust.</p>

<p>“That was like a grave,” said Joan.</p>

<p>Aderhold stood gazing, his hand above his eyes.
“Far off yonder—that is ocean.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>They stood in silence. About them was sunny
stillness; far off lay the sapphire streak. Tension—action—the
mind held to an arduous matter in
hand—in the moments between, exhaustion, concern
only with rest—so had passed the time since
they had crept from the gaol into the black gaol
alley. Now suddenly there came a sense of relaxation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
then of poise, then of time before them. Years—there
might be years.... Even that set amount
and partition dissolved like a mist. They were
going to be together, and their minds placed no
term.</p>

<p>They were, the two of them, sincere and powerful
natures. Now they ceased to look at the ocean which
their bodies would sail, and turned and met each
other’s eyes.... Another division melted from between
them. He had been to her a learned man, of
a station higher than her own. She had said “Sir,”
and “Master Aderhold.” He was still, through circumstance,
more learned than she, with a wider
range of knowledge and suffering, with a subtler
command of peace and mind’s joy. But she had
power to learn and to suffer and to weave joy; there
was no natural inequality. The other inequality, the
unevenness in station, now melted into air. Given
substance only by long convention, it now faded
like a dream and left a man and woman moulded of
one stuff, peers, unity in twain.</p>

<p>“The ocean!” said Joan: “to sail upon the ocean!
What things happen that once you thought were
dreams!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Aderhold. “Long to the height—imagine
to the height—build in the ether....”</p>

<p>They moved toward the sea. The country was not
populous. Avoiding as they did all beaten ways,
taking cover where they might of wood or hillside,
they seemed to have come into a realm of security.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
They were faint with hunger. Before them rose a
solitary cottage bowered in trees. After weighing it
this way and that, they went forward soft-footed,
and peered from behind a stout hedge of thorn. A
blue feather curled from the chimney, the door
stood open, and on a sunny-space of grass three
young women were spreading linen to bleach. They
hummed and chattered as they worked; they were
rosy and comely, and looked kind.</p>

<p>Aderhold spoke with his hands on the top of the
gate. “Maidens, will you give two hungry folk a
bite and a sup? We can pay a penny for it.”</p>

<p>The three looked up and stood in doubt; then one
ran to the cottage door. An elderly woman, tall and
comely, appeared, hearkened to her daughter, then
stepped across the bit of green to the gate. “Be you
vagrants and masterless men?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Aderhold. “We are honest folk
seeking work, which we look to find in the port.
We are not far from it, good mistress?”</p>

<p>“Less than three miles by the path, the lane, and
the road,” said the woman. “You can see the roofs
and towers and, if you listen, hear the church bells.”</p>

<p>They were, indeed, ringing, a faint, silver sound.
Aderhold listened; then, “We are very hungry. If
we might buy a loaf of you we would eat it as we
walked—”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’ll give you bread,” said the woman. “I
or mine might be hungry, too, sometime—and
what odds if we never were!” She spoke to one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the three standing amid the bleaching linen. “Alice!
get the new-baked loaf—”</p>

<p>Alice turned toward the cottage. The two others
came nearer to the gate. The church bells were still
ringing, fine and far and faint. They seemed to bring
something to the woman’s mind. “They say they’ve
taken the Hawthorn folk who ran from prison.”</p>

<p>“Where—”</p>

<p>“Two men came by and told us. A miller and his
men and dogs took them last night. They fought
with fire and Satan was seen above the mill-wheel.
But they took them all, the two men said, and gave
them to the nearest constable, and so now the countryside
can rest.” She stood with her capable air of
strength and good nature, looking over the green
earth to the distant town. “There must be witches
because God wrote the Bible and it cannot be mistaken.
Otherwise, of course, there are a lot of things.... I
used to know Hawthorn when I was a girl.
And Roger Heron. More years than one I danced
with him about the maypole—for then we had
maypoles.”</p>

<p>“Roger Heron!” It was Joan who spoke.</p>

<p>“Aye. I was thinking.... He’s dead of the
plague. And his daughter’s Joan Heron, the main
witch. Life’s a strange thing.”</p>

<p>Her daughter brought the loaf of bread and also a
pitcher of milk and two earthenware cups. The
other girls left the white, strewn linen and drew near.
The cottage was a lonely one, and few passed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
by nature all were kind-hearted and social. Alice
gave a cup to each of the wanderers, and then, tilting
the pitcher, filled the cups with milk. Giles and John
Allen thanked her and, hungry and thirsty to exhaustion,
drank and were refreshed.</p>

<p>But Joan, when she had put down the cup, moved
nearer to the mother of the three. “Did you ever
see—the witch?”</p>

<p>The woman, who had been listening to the church
bells, turned her strong and kindly face. “Roger
Heron brought her here once when she was a child.
There was no ill in her then—or I saw it not. Roger
Heron should not have had an evil child. There was
little evil in him.”</p>

<p>The middle daughter was more prim of countenance
than the others. She now put on a shocked
look. “But, mother! That is to deny Original Sin
and Universal Guilt!”</p>

<p>The elder woman made a gesture with her hand.
It had in it a slight impatience. “I do not mean,”
she said, “that we haven’t all of everything in us.
But Roger Heron was a good man.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the youngest daughter, “how any one
can be a witch and hurt and harm, and be lost for
aye, and leave a vile name—”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said the second; “to know that your
name was Joan Heron, and that it would be a byword
for a hundred years!”</p>

<p>“I am glad that Roger Heron died of the plague
and waited not for a broken heart,” said the mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and took the pitcher from the grass. “How far have
you walked to-day?”</p>

<p>Aderhold answered. Presently, the loaf of bread in
hand, he said that they must go on if they would reach
the port before night, and that they gave warm
thanks for kindness.... They left the friendly cottage
with the sunny spread of grass and the bleaching
linen and the kindly women. A dip of the land,
a turn of the path, and all vanished as if they had
sunk into earth. Before them, fraying the horizon,
they saw the distant town.</p>

<p>Aderhold spoke. “You were there when you were
a child. Do you remember it?”</p>

<p>She answered. “I remembered at last—not at
first: not plainly. I remember the sea.”</p>

<p>Her voice was broken. He looked and saw that
she was weeping.</p>

<p>He had not seen her so since the last time he had
come to Heron’s cottage, and she had wept for her
father’s death. There had been no weeping in prison,
nor in that Judgement Hall, nor since. He knew without
telling that though she felt grief, she controlled
grief. But now, startled by a tide she had not looked
for, control was beaten down. All about them was a
solitariness, a green and silent, sunny world. She
struggled for a moment, then with a gesture of wild
sorrow, sank upon a wayside rise of earth and hid her
face. “Weep it out,” said Aderhold in a shaken
voice; “it will do you good.”</p>

<p>He stood near her, but did not watch her or touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
her. Instead he broke the loaf of bread into portions
and kept a lookout north and south and east
and west. No human being came into range of vision.
The slow minutes went by, then came Joan’s
voice, broken yet, but steadying with every word.
“All that is over now—I’ll not do that again.”</p>

<p>She came up to him and took a piece of the bread.
“Let us go on. We can eat it as we go.”</p>

<p>They walked on.</p>

<p>“It was Gervaise and Lantern,” said Aderhold,
“who told her that tale of a capture at the mill.
They are ahead.... I have seen brave men and
women, but I have seen none braver than you,
Joan.... Life is very great. There are in it threads
of all colours and every tone that is, and if happiness
is not stable, neither is misery. You are brave—be
brave enough to be happy!”</p>

<p>The sun declined, the town ahead grew larger
against a soft and vivid sky. Now they could see the
harbour and that there were ships at anchor. They
now met, overtook, or were passed by people. Some
spoke, some went on preoccupied, but none stopped
and questioned them. They entered the town by a
travelled way, slipping in with a crowd of carts and
hucksters. Within, and standing for a moment looking
back, they saw coming with dust and jingling the
party that had passed them lying in the pit.</p>

<p>They turned, struck into a narrow way that led
downward to the sea, and came upon the waterside
in the red sunset light. A fishwife crossed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
path. “The Moon Tavern? Yonder, beyond the
nets.” They came to it in the dusk, its sign a great,
full moon with a man, a dog, and a thornbush on
the golden ground. As it loomed before them, Gervaise
stepped from the shadow of a heap of timber.
“Greeting, Giles and John! George Dragon and I
have been here this hour.—And yonder lies the
Silver Queen.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SILVER QUEEN</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">The Silver Queen</span>, a ship neither great nor small,
high-pooped, white-sailed, her figurehead a crowned
woman, her name good for seaworthiness, ploughed
the green water. Her sailors and the adventurers for
new lands whom she carried watched their own island
sink from view, watched the European coast,
saw it also fade, saw only the boundless, restless
main. The ship drove south, for the Indies’ passage.</p>

<p>Mariners and all, she carried a hundred and
sixty souls. Captain Hugh Bard was the captain—a
doughty son of the sea. Her sailors were fair
average, tough of body, in mind some brutal, some
weak, some good and true men. She was carrying
colonists and adventurers to the New World, accessions
to the lately established settlement at Jamestown.
Among these men were sober-minded Englishmen,
reputable and not ill-to-do, men who had
warred or traded with credit in various parts of the
world, who had perhaps joined in earlier ventures to
American shores. These carried with them labourers,
indentured servants, perhaps a penniless kinsman
or two, discontented at home. The mass of
those upon the Silver Queen were followers and indentured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
men. But there were likewise adventurers
going singly, free lances, with enough or just enough
to pay passage, men all for change and roving, or
dare-devil men, or men with wild fancies, hopes,
ambitions, intents, or men merely leaving worst
things for a conjectural better. Also there were a
few who thought to practise their professions in the
new settlement, a barber and perfumer, a musician,
a teacher, a lawyer, and a divine. It was an average
swarm from old England, in the early years of colonization.</p>

<p>Aboard was but one woman, and she was not
known as a woman. She was called John Allen, and
went as the still-mouthed and loneliness-loving
brother of the chirurgeon Giles Allen. In the first
days the latter had stated to a group, from which
John Allen had risen and gone away, that his brother
was but now recovering from a melancholy brought
about by the death of one whom he had loved. Now
those aboard were not beasts, but men with, in the
main, answering hearts to lovers’ joys and woes.
For the most part not over-observant or critical, and
with their own matters much in mind, they took the
statement as it was given them and allowed to John
Allen silence and solitude—such silence and solitude
as were obtainable. Silence and solitude were all
around upon the great sea, but the ship was a hive
adrift.</p>

<p>Captain Hugh Bard was under obligations to Sir
Richard. Clients of Sir Richard—nothing known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
but that they were folk whom that knight was willing
to help from England—were sure of his blunt
good offices. Moreover, the ship’s doctor fell ill,
whereupon Giles Allen offered his services, there
being much sickness among the colonists. The captain
nodded, found that he had aboard a skilled
physician, and took a liking to the man himself.
Aderhold asked no favours for himself, and none
that might arouse suspicion for her who passed as
his brother. But yet, with a refinement of skill, he
managed to obtain for her what she wanted in that
throng of men—a little space, a little distance.</p>

<p>She never added difficulty to their situation. She
was no fine lady. She was yeoman born and bred,
courageous and sane. It was yet the evening glow of
the strong Elizabethan age. Men and women were
more frank and free in one another’s company than
grew to be the case in a later period. The wife or
mistress, sometimes the sister, in the dress of page or
squire, fellow traveller, attendant at court, sometimes
fellow soldier, made a commonplace of the
age’s stage-play or romantic tale. If the masquerade
occurred oftener in poem or play than in fact, yet
in the last-named, too, it occurred.</p>

<p>Joan had native wit. Her being, simple-seeming,
pushed forward complexes enough when it came to
the touch. Aderhold marvelled to see her so skilful
and wary, and still so quiet with it all that she
seemed to act without motion, or with motion too
swift for perception. She went unsuspected of all—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
tall, fair youth with grey eyes and a manner of
reserve, brooding aside over some loss of his own.</p>

<p>Giles Allen, John Allen, George Dragon—it was
George Dragon, Aderhold came to see, who furnished
the danger point.—Humphrey Lantern was
no artist to put forward a self complete, yet not
your home and most familiar self. He had no considerable
rôle to play; he was merely George Dragon,
an old soldier of the Dutch Wars, who since had
knocked about as best he might, and now would try
his fortune in Virginia. He was at liberty to talk of
the good wars and the Low Countries all he wished.
He sought the forecastle and the company of the
ruder sort and he talked of these. But he was forgetful,
and at times the near past would trip up the far
past. Never the very near past, but Aderhold had
heard him let slip that for part time since the good
wars, he had served as a gaoler—“head man in a
good prison,” he put it with a grim touch of pride.
Aderhold thought that some one had given him
usquebaugh to drink. When he cautioned him, as he
earnestly did at the first chance, Lantern could not
remember that he had said any such thing, but,
being sober, he agreed that the least thing might be
spark to gunpowder, and that their lives depended
upon discretion. He promised and for some time
Aderhold observed him exercising due caution. But
the fear remained, and the knowledge that Lantern
would drink if tempted, and drunken knew not what
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>At first they had a favouring wind and seas not
rough or over-smooth. The ship bore strongly on,
and the spirits of most aboard were good. Now and
then broke out revelry and boisterousness, but the
men of weight kept rule among their followers, and
Captain Hugh Bard would have order where he
commanded. The wilder sort, of whom there were
enough aboard, must content themselves with suppressed
quarrels, secret gaming, a murmur of feverish
and unstable talk and conjecture. There were
those who, wherever they were, must have excitement
to feed upon. Their daily life must be peppered
with a liberal hand, heightened to a fevered
and whirling motion with no line of advance. These
were restless, and spread their restlessness upon the
Silver Queen. But there was much stolidity aboard,
and at first and for many days it counteracted.</p>

<p>The wind blew, the sails filled, they drove cheerily
on. They came to the Canaries, on the old passage,
then drove westward. Days passed, many days.
They came to where they might begin to look for
islands. And here a storm took them and carried
them out of their reckoning, and here their luck fell
away from them. The storm was outlasted, but
after it there befell a calm. The wind failed, sank
away until there was not a breath. Sullen and stubborn,
the calm lasted, weary day after weary day.
The sails hung lank, the water made not even a small
lipping sound, the crowned woman at the prow stood
full length and steady, staring at a glassy floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
The sea was oil, the sky brazen, and the spirits
flagged like the flagging sails. Day after day, day
after day...</p>

<p>At dawn one morning Aderhold and Joan leaned
against the rail and looked at the purple sea. It lay
like a vast gem, moveless and hard. The folk upon
the ship were still sleeping. The seamen aloft in the
rigging or moving upon the decks troubled them not,
hardly looked their way.</p>

<p>“If you held a feather before you,” said Joan, “it
would not move a hair’s breadth! They are to pray
for a wind to-day. Master Evans will pray—all
aboard will pray. Is it chained somewhere, or idle
or asleep, or locked in a chest, and will we turn the
key that way?”</p>

<p>“Did you see or speak to George Dragon yesterday?”</p>

<p>“No. Why?”</p>

<p>“Some of these men brought <i>aqua vitæ</i> or usquebaugh
aboard with them. He games for it and wins.
And then his tongue wags more than it should.”</p>

<p>“I did not know.... Danger, again?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He thinks he has done no harm, then is
alarmed, penitent, protests that he will not—and
then it’s all done again.... Poor human weakness!”</p>

<p>“And if—?”</p>

<p>“We will not look at that now,” said Aderhold.
“It would unroll itself soon enough.—Joan, Joan!
I would that you were safe!”</p>

<p>“I am safe. I would that you—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will match your ‘I am safe.’ I, too, am safe.
Nothing here can quench the eternal, flowing life!
But until we have lifted this level and built more
highly we shall feel its pains ... and feel them for
one another. And now I ache for your danger.”</p>

<p>The east was carmine, the sea from purple turned
carmine—carmine eastward from the Silver Queen
to the horizon; elsewhere a burnished play of greens
and blues, a vast plain, still, still! It flowed around
and away to the burning horizon, and not a sail and
not a breath, and no sound in the cordage overhead.
The deepening light flowed between Joan and Aderhold,
and in it, suddenly, the body of each was
beautiful in the other’s eyes.... The sun came up, a
red-gold ball. Neither man nor woman had spoken,
and now, suddenly, too, with the full dayspring, the
ship was astir, men were upon the decks. Gilbert
Aderhold, Joan Heron stepped back into the violet
shadow; here were Giles and John Allen.</p>

<p>Up to these now came Master Evans, the minister
bound for Jamestown, a stout, gentle-faced man in
a sad-coloured suit. “Fast as though the ship were
in the stocks!” he said. “But if the Lord is gracious,
we will pray her free! Breakfast done, we will gather
together and make hearty supplication.” He looked
across to the sun, mailed now in diamond, mounting
blinding and fierce. The sweet coolness of the earlier
hour was gone; wave on wave came heat, heat, heat!
Master Evans clasped more closely the Bible in his
hand. “Thou sun whom for Israel’s sake the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
halted in thy course and held thee nailed fast above
Gibeon! Dost thou think if He chooses now to veil
thy face with cloud and to blow thy rays aside, thou
canst prevent? And thou hot and moveless air, if
He choose to drive thee against the stern of this ship
and into the hollow of these sails, wilt thou make
objection? Nay, verily! And why should He not
choose? Here upon this ship are not infidels and
heathen, but his own servants and sheep! Wherefore
we will kneel and beseech Him, and perchance a
miracle may fall like manna.”</p>

<p>He looked smilingly about him, then, pressing his
Bible closely, went on to other emigrants.... Later
in the morning all upon the Silver Queen were
drawn together to make petition for a prospering
wind. All save the sick were there. Giles and John
Allen stood with the others, knelt with the others.
“Have we not a chronicle of Thy deeds,” prayed
Master Evans. “Didst Thou not make a dry road
through an ocean for a chosen people? Didst Thou
not, at the Tower of Babel, in one hour shake one
language into all the tongues that are heard upon the
earth? Didst Thou not enable Noah to bring into
the Ark in pairs all the beasts of this whole earth?
Didst Thou not turn a woman into a pillar of salt,
and give powers of speech to an ass, and preserve
three men unsinged in a fiery furnace? Didst Thou
not direct the dew on the one night to moisten only
the fleece of Gideon and not any of the earth besides,
and on the next night to glisten over the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
earth, but to leave the fleece unmoistened? And are
not we thy servants even as were Gideon and Lot
and Noah?...”</p>

<p>The calm held. A sky of brass, an oily sea, heat
and heat, and now more sickness, and now an uneasy
whisper as to the store of water! The whisper
grew, for the ship lay still, day after day, as though
she had never moved nor ever would do so. Panic
terror came and hovered near the Silver Queen.
Captain Bard fell ill, lay in fever and delirium....
The mate took command—no second Captain
Bard, but a frightened man himself. There was
aboard a half-crazed fellow who began to talk of
Ill-Luck. “The ship hath Ill-Luck. Who brought it
aboard? Seek it out and tie it to the mast and shoot
it with your arquebuse! Then, mayhap, the wind
will blow.” He laughed and mouthed of Ill-Luck,
until crew and passengers all but saw a shadowy
figure. Time crawled by, and the calm held and the
panic grew.</p>

<p>There came an hour when the bolt fell, foreseen by
Aderhold. Before it ran a whisper; then there fell a
pause and an ominous quiet; then burst the voices,
fast and thick. It was afternoon, the sun not far
from the horizon, the sea red glass. Aderhold came
up on deck from the captain’s cabin. He looked
about him and saw a crowd drawn together. Out of
it issued a loud voice. “Ill-Luck? What marvel
there is ill-luck?” Noise mounted. The half-crazed
fellow suddenly began to shrill out, “Ill-Luck! Ill-Luck!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
There she sits!” He burst from the throng
and pointed with his finger. Away from the stir, on
a great coil of rope near a slung boat, there sat,
looking out to sea, John Allen.</p>

<p>The mate, with him several of the more authoritative
adventurers and also Master Evans, came out
of the state cabin. “What’s all this? What has
happened?”</p>

<p>A man of the wilder sort aboard, a ruffler and
gamester, was pushed forward by the swarm. “My
masters, there’s one aboard named George Dragon
who, being somewhat drunk, hath let drop news
that we hold hath a bearing upon this ship’s poor
fortune! He saith that we carry escaped prisoners—runaways
from the King’s justice—rebels, too, to
religion—”</p>

<p>“Ill Luck! Ill Luck! There sits Ill Luck!” cried
the half-crazed one, and pointed again.</p>

<p>The swarm began to speak with a general voice.
“And we say that we won’t get a wind, but will lie
here until water is gone and we die of thirst and rot
and sink.... If we’ve got men aboard who are
bringing misfortune on us.... Twelve days lying
here and not a breath! The captain ill and twenty
men besides, and the water low.... There’s Scripture
for it.... What’s the good of praying for a
wind, if all the time we’re harbouring his foes?...
Held here, as though we were nailed to the sea floor,
and the water low! The ship’s cursed.... We want
George Dragon made to tell their names—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly George Dragon himself was among them—red-faced
and wry-mouthed, but to-day thick-tongued
also and stumbling. He looked about him
wildly. “What’s all this chattering? Talking like
monkeys!—Waked me up—but I won and he
paid—good stuff—” He saw Aderhold and
lurched toward him. When he was near he spoke
and imagined that none else could hear him. “Don’t
look so grimly upon me, Master Aderhold!” he said.
“I’ve dropped not a word, as I told you I wouldn’t.
’Zooks! I’m not one to peach—”</p>

<p><i>Aderhold!</i> With one sharp sound the name ran
through the swarm. “Not Allen!—<i>Aderhold</i>....”
There were those here from that port town and the
surrounding country,—those who had heard that
name before. A man cried out, “Aderhold! That
was the sorcerer who was to be burned!” Another:
“They escaped—The sorcerer and apostate and
the witch Joan Heron—”</p>

<p>“Ill Luck! Ill Luck!” cried the Bedlamite. “There
she stands!”</p>

<p>John Allen had risen from the coil of rope and
stood against the slung boat. The throng swung its
body that way, hung suspended one long moment,
open-mouthed, wide-eyed, then with a roaring cry-flung
itself across the space between. Aderhold
reached her side, but the throng came, too, hurled
him down and laid hands upon her. One clutched
her shirt and jerkin and tore them across. She stood
a woman revealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>“The witch! The witch!” they roared and struck
her to the deck.</p>

<p>The mate was not the man that was the captain,
but he knew what the captain would do, and where
he was able he copied. The few superior colonists
were not superior to witch-fear, but they had a preference
for orderly judgement and execution. Master
Evans was of a timid and gentle nature and abhorred
with his bodily eyes to see violence done. He
believed devoutly that in the interests of holiness
witches, infidels, and sorcerers must be put to death,
but he would not willingly himself behold the act
which his religion approved. There were others
aboard amenable to discipline, and bold enough to
escape panic over mere delay. The sorcerer and the
witch were drawn from the hands of the more enraged.
Their arms were bound across; they were
thrust into the ship’s dungeon. With them went
Humphrey Lantern, sober enough now—poor wry-mouthed
man!... In the state cabin there was held
a council. “Keep the wretches close under hatches
until Virginia is reached,” said the cooler sense.
“Then let the officers of the settlement hang them,
on dry land and after solemn judgement. Or let
them be prisoned in Jamestown until a ship is sailing
home, taken back to England, and hanged there. If,
as may well be the case, the Silver Queen hath been
cursed for their sakes, surely now that they are
ironed there below, and their doom certain in the
end, the Almighty will lift the curse! At least, wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and see if the calm be not broken.” Within the
cabin and without were malcontents, but the soberer
counsel prevailed. The mate agreed to keep the
crew from mutiny, the moderate-minded adventurers
to tame the wilder, more frightened and impatient
spirits.... That very night the calm vanished.</p>

<p>The calm vanished in a wild uprush of clouds and
stir of the elements. The heat and savour of brass,
the stillness of death, the amazing blue of the sky,
the splashed red of sunrise and sunset went away.
In their place came darkness and a roaring wind.
At first they went under much canvas; it was a
drunken delight to feel the spray, to see the crowned
woman drink the foam, to hear the whistling and the
creaking, to know motion again. But presently they
took in canvas.... Twenty-four hours after the first
hot puff of air, they were being pushed, bare-masted,
as by a giant’s hand over a sea that ran in
mountains. The sky was black-purple, torn by
lightnings, the rain fell with a hissing fury, the wind
howled now, howled too loudly!</p>

<p>As the calm would not break, so now the storm
would not break. It roared and howled and the
water curved and broke over the decks of the Silver
Queen. A mast went, the ship listed, there arose a
cry. The rain and lightning and thunder ceased, but
never the wind and the furious sea and the darkened
sky. The Silver Queen was beaten from wave to
wave, now smothered in the hollow, now rising dizzily
to the moving summit. The waves combed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
her, they struck her as with hammers, her seamen
cried out that there was sprung a leak, it came to be
seen that she might not live. The panic of the calm
gave way to that of the storm.</p>

<p>And now they cried out wildly that the voyage
was cursed, and that God Almighty who had
plagued Israel for Achan’s sin was plaguing them
for that they kept aboard most vile offenders and
rebels such as these! Those that were still for delay
kept quarter yet a little longer, but while the wind
somewhat lessened, the leak gained, and panic attacked
them too. The captain lay ill and out of his
head, the mate was no stronger than they who
wished clearance made. In a black and wild morning,
the livid sky dragging toward them, the sea running
high, they lowered a boat and placed in it
Aderhold and Joan and Humphrey Lantern. They
might, perhaps, have held the last with them, carrying
him in irons to Virginia, but when he found
what was toward he cursed them so horribly that no
wizard could have thought of worse imprecations.
They shivered and thrust him into the boat, where
he knelt and continued his raving. “Hush!” said
Aderhold. “Let us die quietly.”</p>

<p>The sailors loosed the small boat and pushed it
outward from the Silver Queen. It fell astern, the
black water widened between. The ship, mad to get
on, to put distance between her and the curse, flung
out what sail the tempest would let her carry. It
made but a slight pinion, but yet wing enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
take her from that speck upon the ocean, the boat
she had set adrift.... Not she had set adrift, but
Ignorance, Fear and Superstition, their compound,
Cruelty, and their blind Prætorian, Brute Use of
Brute Force. There had been one pale ray of something
else. Master Evans had insisted that there be
put in the boat a small cask of water and a portion
of ship’s bread.</p>

<p>The Silver Queen hurried, hurried over the wild
and heaving sea, beneath a low sky as grey as iron.
The many gazing still lost at last all sight of the open
boat. It faded into the moving air, or it was drawn
into the sea, they knew not which. But it was gone,
and they made bold to hope that now God would
cease to plague them.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE OPEN BOAT</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">That</span> day and night they in the open boat merely
lived to die. With each wave of a sea yet in storm
Death overhung them, the foam atop gleaming
down like a white skull. The boat rode that wave,
and then Death rose on another. There seemed
naught to do in life but to meet Death—a little
candle left to go forth by. Death preoccupied them—it
was so wide and massive, it came against them
in such tourney shocks. “Now ... No!—Then
now....” But still the boat lived and the candle
burned. When the dawn broke the waves were seen
to be lessening in might.</p>

<p>That day the sea went down and the sky cleared.
Sea and sky turned a marvel of blue, Indian, wondrous.
There was a wind, steadily and quietly blowing,
but it served them not who had no sail. All
around—all around the intense sea spread to the
horizon, and no sail showed and no land. The sun
mounted and for all the moving air they felt its
heat which increased. Heat and light—light—light....</p>

<p>The cask of water.... They found beside it a
small drinking-cup of horn, and they agreed that each
should drink this once filled each day. It was little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
but so they might keep Death at bay so many days.
They also portioned out the ship’s bread. Likewise
they watched for a sail. They were now in seas
where ships might be looked for; west and south
must lie the islands held by Spain. Once two sea-birds
flew past them, and that would mean that land
was not inconceivably far away. But they saw no
land, and no sail was etched against the sapphire
sky. Loneliness profound, and heat and light....</p>

<p>All was done that could be done to preserve life.
It remained to live it.... But poor Humphrey Lantern,
whom the other two tried to comfort, would
not be comforted. He sat and bit his nails, full of
remorse and horror, then passed through stages of
anger to a melancholy, and thence to a dull indifference,
silence, and abstraction. They could not rouse
him. Aderhold spoke in vain of the Low Countries
and the wars, and of all the good that they owed him,
and of how they might yet live to remember these
days not unkindly. Lantern, huddled in the bottom
of the boat, looked at them blankly. His abused
body sank more quickly than did theirs.... He had
a knife, and at last one night, when they had been
drifting long days and nights, he struck it into his
heart. The body, swaying against Aderhold, roused
him from uneasy sleep. His exclamation waked
Joan; she put out her hand and raised it wet with
blood. A moon so great and shining lit the night
that they could see well enough what had been done.
Lantern was dead. They laid him straight in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
bottom of the boat. Aderhold drew out and washed
the knife, and then they sat beside the dead man
until the moon paled in the vast rose-flush of dawn.
Then, while sea and sky were so beauteous, they
lifted the body; then, while they looked to the
brightening east, let it leave their hands for the
great deep. Wind and current bore the boat slowly
onward and away. The two were now so weak that
they lay still as after great and prolonged exertion.</p>

<p>The day burned to its height, flamed to its close.
There came a sunset of supernal beauty, and then
the pitying, brief twilight and the glory of the
southern night. The coolness gave a little strength.
Aderhold set the cup to the mouth of the cask and
poured for each a shallow draught of water. They
should not have drunk till morning, for their store
was nearly gone. But with one mind they took this,
to give them voice, to free them for a little from gross
pain. When it was done they turned each to the
other, came each to the other’s arms.</p>

<p>Another dawn—the furnace of the day—sunset—the
night. The wheel went round and they,
bound to it, came again to dawn and then to strong
light and heat. When they had drunk this morning,
there remained of the water but one cupful more.
They lay, hand clasping hand, in the bottom of the
boat that now drifted on a waveless sea. Sometimes
they murmured to each other, but for the most part
they lay silent. There was now no outward beauty
in the two. They lay withered, scorched, fleshless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
half-naked, human life at last gasp between the
ocean and the sky. Within, all strength and beauty
could summon only negatives. They did not complain,
they did not curse, they did not despair, they
did not hate. Within was a stillness as of a desert,
with a low wind of life moving over it. The physical
could not lift far into emotion, but what there was
was love and pity. Emotion could hardly attain to
thought, nor thought to intuition, but what there
was knew still the splendour and terror and all
things that we are. Day—eve—the night—the
dawn—day. They measured out the last water in
the cask and shared it justly between them. They
lay side by side, his hand upon her breast, her hand
upon his. The fierce heat, the fierce sunlight rose
and reigned....</p>

<p>A crazy, undecked sailboat came out of the haze.
It was returning from a great island south to a group
of small islands lying northerly in these seas, and it
held five or six Indians—not the fiercer, southern
Caribs, but mild Lucayans. One spied a dot upon
the waters and pointed it out. They drew slowly
nearer in a light wind, and when they saw that it was
a boat adrift, tacked and came up with it. A man
leaned overboard, seized and drew it in, and with a
rope fastened it to the stern of the larger craft.
Uttering exclamations, they examined their prize.
In the bottom of the boat lay a man and a woman in
man’s dress. They lay unconscious, wreathed in
each other’s arms, two parched and gaunt creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
who had suffered the extremity of exposure, hunger,
and thirst. The Indians thought that they were
dead, and, indeed, they looked like death and terrible
death. But when they were lifted and dragged
into the larger boat, and when water was put between
their blackened and shrivelled lips, there
came a faint stir and a moaning breath.... The
Indians had good store of water in cask and calabash;
they gave it again from time to time, and
they crumbled cassava bread and fed that too....
Joan and Aderhold turned back to the land of the
living.</p>

<p>At first the Indians thought that they were Spanish,
for they had no association with other white
men. Association with the Spaniard had been cruel
enough for them; they belonged to the disappearing
remnant of a people swept by the thousands from
their islands to the larger islands, enslaved, oppressed,
extirpated. These in the boat were runaways
from a hard master, who had stolen this boat
and put out, crazy as it was, on what might seem a
hopeless voyage. Did they pass through days and
nights, and leagues and leagues of sea and go uncaptured
by some Spanish craft, did they come at last
to their own island, what would they find there? A
desert, with, perhaps, a tiny cluster of palm-thatched
huts, still clinging, looking for some landing party,
looking to be swept away as had been their kith and
kin—a perishing group, dejection, languor of life....
But homesickness drove them on; better a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
death-bed with freedom than the peopled great
island where they were slaves! They had felt the
Spanish lash and the Spanish irons; they looked
doubtfully enough upon the white man and woman,
and it was perhaps a question whether now they
would not pay back.... But when at last Aderhold
spoke, it was in English. They did not know that
tongue and they answered in altered and distorted
Spanish. He had a little Spanish, and he made them
understand briefly that the two had been in an English
ship and that there had been a storm and that
they were castaways. They were not Spanish, and
they did not know the great island or any of the
masters. They were English, whom the Spanish
hated. That fact being weighed, the Indians turned
friendly, laughed and stroked their hands in token
of amity, then set apart for the two a great calabash
of water, and gave them more cassava bread.</p>

<p>Joan and Aderhold ate and drank. The will to
live was strong, for life had turned a rainbow, and a
wild and beautiful forest, and a song of the high and
the deep, and an intense pulsation. The two came
swiftly up from Death’s threshold. Before the boat
came into sight of land the light was back in their
sunken eyes and some strength in their frame....
The land seemed a low, island shore. The excited
Indians gesticulated, spoke in their own tongue.
Aderhold, questioning them, learned that it was the
outermost of their island group, but not their own
island to which they were bound. They saw pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
sand and verdure green as emerald; then the night
came and covered all from sight. No light of torch
or of cooking-fire pierced the darkness. The blank
shores slipped past, the boat left them astern, and
now again all around was the sea.... But though it
was night there was no sleeping. The returning
exiles were excited, restless, garrulous. The two
learned that there were many islands and now
almost no people. The people—the Indians beat
their breasts—were gone now, almost all gone. For
the masters sent men from the great islands to burn
the villages and take the men and women and children
and drive them aboard ships and carry them
off to make poor slaves of them. They had done so
when the oldest men were children, and when the
oldest men’s fathers were children. But now the
masters did not come, for the men and women and
children were all gone—all gone but a few, a few.
The returned from long slavery did not know if
these few were yet there, yet clinging to their island.</p>

<p>Night passed, dawn came, the wind blew them on.
Now they saw islets and islands, but no craft upon
the water, or sign of life. Then, in the afternoon, the
Indians’ lode-star lifted upon the horizon. They put
their helm for it, a freshening wind filled their sail.
Presently they saw it clear, a low island, here ivory
white and here green as emerald. The Indians
shouted and wept. They caressed one another in
their own tongue, they gesticulated, they held out
their arms to the nearing shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>The shore dilated. Reefs appeared to be warily
avoided, and the water grew unearthly blue and
clear. Green plumes of palm seemed to wave and
beckon. Back from the narrow ivory beach, inland
out of a break in the belt of green, rose a feather of
smoke. The Indians when they saw it were as mad
people. They leaped to their feet, they embraced
one another, they laughed, they strained their
bodies toward the land, and broke into a savage
chant of home-coming.... Now they were in a tortuous
channel between <i>cays</i> and the island. The
island beach widened, and now human forms appeared—not
many, and at first with a hesitant and
fearful air; then, as they became assured that here
was only one small sailboat, with a bolder advance,
until at last they came down to the edge of the small
bight to which the boat was heading. They were
Indians like those in the boat, a mild and placable
strain, dulled and weakened by the century-old huge
wrong done them. They were but a handful. In the
whole island there was now but one small village.</p>

<p>The boat glided past a fanged reef and came into a
tiny crystal anchorage where the bright fish played
below like coloured birds in the air. They lowered
sail; they came as close as might be to the shelving
land; the Indians leaped into the water and made
ashore with loud cries and incoherent words. The
islanders swept about them, surrounded them; there
rose a wild, emotional questioning and greeting,
laughing and crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>The infection spread to Joan and Aderhold. Behind
them lay pain and horror, and pain and horror
might again claim them. But now Time had spread
for them a mighty reaction. It was so blessed to be
alive!—they were so prepared to embrace and love
life—every material thing seemed so transfused
and brightly lit from within—they laughed themselves
and felt in their eyes the happy dew....
They, too, must take to the water to come ashore.
It was naught to them, the shallow bright flood.
They crossed it as had done the Indians, and stepped
upon the land.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ISLAND</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">A few</span> miles in length, fewer in breadth, the island
lay in a sub-tropic clime. During its winter all the
air was neither cold nor hot, but of a happy in-between
and suave perfection. Its summer brought
strong heat and at times wild tempests of rain and
wind, thunder and lightning. For the most part the
land rose but a little way above the sea, a shallow
soil with a coral base. Out of this mould sprang a
forest of eternal greenness. Once there had been
a number of villages, each in its small clearing, but
one by one they had been destroyed and the clearings
had gone back to the forest.</p>

<p>This one larger village had outlasted. Dwindling
year by year, before it, at no great term, death and
absorption, when all the island would be desert, it
yet showed a number of irregularly placed, circular
huts woven of branch and reed and thatched with
palm. To this village Joan and Aderhold were
swept together with the escaped slaves, the returned
exiles. Besides the tenanted huts there were others
from which the last of the occupants had died, but
which were not yet fallen to the earth and become a
part of the forest floor. Joan and Aderhold were
given one of these abodes standing under tamarind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and palm, and here food was brought them. All the
village was in commotion, restless and excited, for
seldom and most seldom in all the years did any one
come back.... When night fell there ensued feasting
and revelry, a strange picture-dance, performed
by men and women, long recitatives wherein some
sonorous voice told of this people’s woes, of their
palmy days, and how the white men came in the
time of their fathers, and they took them for gods
and they proved themselves not so—not gods but
devils! The torrent expression of wrongs flowed on.
Sharp cries and wailings came from the dusky
figures seated in an ellipse about the narrator. Eyes
looked angrily across to where the white man and
woman sat and watched.</p>

<p>Among the Indians of the sailboat had been an old
man with a finer, more intelligent face than was to
be found among his fellows. It was he, principally,
who had talked with the castaways. Now, on land, he
constituted himself their advocate and protector.
He had been, it seemed, the chief man of a vanished
village, and this present village, being without a
strong man, looked to him with deference. Now he
rose and spoke and the threatening looks faded.
These Indians were not of a fierce and cruel temper—and
the two strangers were not Spanish, but came
from a tribe whom the Spanish fought.... Danger
to the two from their hosts or captors passed away.</p>

<p>The night went by in noise and feasting. With the
dawn the village sank into sleep. The home-coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
ones needed, after long adventure and strain, rest
and repose, while the friends and kindred at home
were used to swift and calm descendings to immobility
and profound sleep. Within and without the
tent-like huts lay the dusky, well-shaped forms,
almost bare, still as death, lying as though they had
been shot down by invisible arrows. The projecting
palm thatch, the overhanging, thick foliage, kept out
the fierce sun, made a green and brown gloom.</p>

<p>Joan and Aderhold slept, too. For them the immediate
need was health again, strength again, energy
in which to base the wonderful flower of life. They
lay like children near each other, and slept the livelong
day. When, in the last bright light, they
waked, there was cassava bread, and tropic fruit and
water from a neighbouring spring. They ate and
drank and talked a little, about indifferent things—only
nothing now was indifferent, but rich and significant.
But it was as though they would hold away
from them for a little while their deeper bliss; would
not speak of that until they could speak in health,
with glow and vigour and beauty and power!
About them the village half waked, half slept. They
heard women’s and children’s voices, but dreamily.
The woods, that had been very still during the
heat of the day, were now as murmurous as rapids of
a stream. All manner of winged life made a continuous
sound. Joan and Aderhold rested their heads
again upon the woven palm mat and slept the deep
night through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>With the second morning the Indian village resumed
its normal process of existing. The women
practised a kind of embryonic agriculture. The men
hunted not at all, though they trapped birds; but
they fished, pushing out into the turquoise sea in canoes
hollowed from tree-trunks. The women plaited
baskets, and cut and dried gourds large and small.
They had cotton, and they knew how to weave it
into the scant clothing needed in such a clime.
They scraped the cassava root into meal and made
bread, and gathered and brought in the staple fruits.
In the village were to be found in some slight number
and variety matters not of savage make. During
the more than a hundred years since the great
Genoese and his Spanish sailors had come upon this
group, such things had drifted here, as it were, upon
the tide and the winds. Thus there were to be seen
several cutlasses and daggers, together with a rusted
Andrea Ferrara, a great iron pot, and smaller utensils,
a sea-chest, a broken compass, a Spanish short
mantle and hat and feather, some piece of furnishing
from a church, a drinking-cup, a length of iron
chain. But nothing had been left, or had been
traded for with Indians of other villages, for a long,
long time. The islands were desert and forgotten
... except that now of late sea-robbers and pirates
were, for that very reason, taking as anchorage,
refuges, and bases of operation, the intricate channels
and well-concealed harbours. But no pirate
ship had found as yet this inward-lying island. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
rested upon the sea as if forgotten or lost or inaccessible,
and its fading people knew at least a still and
not ungentle autumn.</p>

<p>The old Indian came this morning to visit Aderhold
and Joan. Others had been before him; they had
held, perforce, a kind of levee. The children were not
more curious, nor simpler in their expression of curiosity,
than were the men and women. They had no
language in common with the castaways but that of
gesture, but they made this answer. The torn, sun-faded
clothing of the two, the fineness and tint of
their hair, the colour of their skin, Joan’s grey eyes,
the absurd sound of their speech at which the Indians
laughed heartily—every physical trait was of
interest. But as with children attention went little
further than that and was quick to flag. The levee
dispersed.</p>

<p>But the old man’s interest went beyond eyes and
hair and a fair skin. He could speak in Spanish, too,
and Aderhold could answer. He was as curious as
the others, but his curiosity had a wider mental range.
The strangers’ country and its nature—their rank
there—why they left it—had their ship utterly
perished in the hurricane—these and other questions
he asked, with his fine, old, chieftain, shrewd,
not unhumorous face. Aderhold answered with as
much frankness as was possible. The old chief listened,
nodded, said briefly that he had heard men in
the great island speak of those other white men, the
English, and how they fought like devils. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
devils’ devil not what I call devil,” said the chief.
“Devils’ god what I call devil.”</p>

<p>He wished to know if the English were not coming
to fight the Spanish, and his eyes lit up, “Then come
rest here. Englishmen wouldn’t stamp foot upon us—eh?”
He observed that the hut was old and falling
down. “Not good place. Too much tree—too
much other houses all around. I like place see the
water—night and morning. Sit and think, think
where it ends.” He offered to have them a house
built. “Do it in one day. When you like it you look,
say where.”</p>

<p>Presently he gazed at them thoughtfully, and held
up two fingers. “Sister and brother?”</p>

<p>“No, not sister and brother. We are lovers.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ah!” said the old chief. “I thought that,
yonder in the boat.—What is her name—and your
name?”</p>

<p>“Joan—and Gilbert.”</p>

<p>The old man said them over, twice and thrice,
pleased at mastering the strange sounds. “Joan—Gilbert.
Joan—Gilbert.” At last he went away,
but that was the beginning of a long and staunch
friendship.</p>

<p>The day passed, the night. Another day dawned
and ran onward to an afternoon marvellously fair.
The season of hurricanes and great heat was passing;
the air was growing temperate, life-giving. This day
had been jewel-clear, with a tonic, blowing wind,
strong and warm. The narrow shore-line of wave-worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
rock and coralline sand lay only a little way
from the village. In the latter occurred a continual,
sleepy oscillation of its particles, talk and encounter,
and privacy had not been invented. Joan and Aderhold,
fairly as strong now as on that night when with
Gervaise and Lantern they broke prison, went this
afternoon down to the sea.</p>

<p>It stretched before them, the great matrix from
which the life of the land had broken, the ancient
habitat. They left the village behind; a point of
woodland came between them and it. Now there
was only the ocean, the narrow shore, the lift of
palms and many another tropic tree, and the arch of
the deep blue sky. The tide was coming in. They
sat upon a ledge of coral rock and watched it. The
water, beyond the foam of the breaking rollers,
seemed of an intenser hue than the sky itself—and
calm, calm—with never a sail, never a sail.</p>

<p>“We may live here and die here—an old man
and woman,” said Joan: “die together.”</p>

<p>“I am thirty-four years old,” said Aderhold. “I
will have to die before you.”</p>

<p>“No. I will die a little sooner than I might.”</p>

<p>“No! I will grow younger—”</p>

<p>“We talk nonsense,” said Joan. “We sit here, as
young and as old each as the other! And we shall
die together.”</p>

<p>A wave broke at their feet with a hollow sound. It
fell on her last word, and it seemed to repeat it with a
sullen depth, <i>Together</i>. It came to both that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
were to have died together, there in England, and
that if ever they were retaken, as the great strangeness
of life might permit, then certainly in all probability
they would die together. That was one way in
which the granting of their wish might be taken as
assured.... But they saw no sail, and they saw that
now the village never looked for a sail.... Safety
might, indeed, have come to dwell with them. The
thought of omen faded out.</p>

<p>The wind blew around them warm and strong. It
was full tide, and about them foam and pearl, and
the voice of mother sea. They sat with clasped
hands on their coral ledge. It was coming back to
them—it had come back to them—health and
glow and colour and spring. Joan was fairer than
she had been in Heron’s cottage. First youth, youth
of the senses, youth controlled and well-guided, but
youth, revived like the phœnix in Aderhold the
scholar. He had seemed graver and older than he
truly was. In him strength, activity, adventure,
interest, will, and daring had early risen into the
realm of the mind. There they had bourgeoned,
pressed on, been light of step and high of heart. But
the outward man had not been able to keep pace.
Now a deep passion changed that. He looked as
young as Joan; both looked immortal youth. Each
put hands upon the other’s shoulders, they drew
together, they kissed. The voice of the ocean, and of
the wind and of the forest spoke for them, and their
own hearts spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day, when the old chief visited them,
they went back to his proposal of a new house. The
idea found him ready as a child. It was among his
traits to be easily fired with the joy of building. He
would speak to the chief men and the young men,
and they would tell the women to do it at once.
Where would Joan and Gilbert—he produced the
names with pride—have it built?</p>

<p>They took him with them and showed him. Just
without the village, so near that they could hear its
murmur, yet so far that there was not oppression, in
a rich grove, opening to a bit of sandy shore and a
wide view of the azure sea.... The old chief gazed
with appreciation, nodded, “Good! Go talk to chief
men now.” So much a man of his word was he that
the next day saw the women bringing bundles of
reeds and palm leaves for the thatching. Also young
trees were cut for the posts. Aderhold and Joan
studied the method, saw how they might extend, add
a shed-like room or two, make a gallery for working
under shade. The old chief and the others, too, from
the great island, had ideas. The village was in a gay,
a stimulated mood. It was a gala month—not
every other day, nor any other day, did captive
tribesmen come back, or castaways appear that were
not Spanish, human driftwood making human interest!
They built for the two from far away so large
and good a house that they themselves marvelled at
it. “Houses like that”—a woman said to Joan—“in
houses like that our fathers live, eating bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
with the Great Spirit!” When the house was done,
the village feasted, and an Indian, rising, addressed
the castaways and said that now they were members
and an adopted man and woman of the tribe, and
that the village expected much good from them.
“We show you how we do—you show us how your
people do—show us how to kill Spaniards when
they come!”</p>

<p>The next day Joan and Aderhold took possession
of their house. When the crowd who had accompanied
them to it was gone, and when the old chief
was gone, and when there came the evening stir
and murmur from the village, the two built their
fire, and Joan made cakes of cassava bread and
Aderhold brought water from a little spring that was
their own. They had gold and russet fruit, and they
sat and ate before their own door and were content.
It was a bright and lovely evening, with a light upon
the sea and the palm fronds slowly swinging. The
voice of the village came not harshly, but with a certain
mellow humming, and the voice of the sea upon
the reef came not harshly either. When the meal was
finished, they covered the embers of their fire so that
it should not go out, then rose from their knees and
hand in hand went the round of their domain. Here
they would make a garden, here they would bring the
water to a trough nearer the hut. Back at the doorway
they looked within and saw their house fair and
clean, yet fragrant of the green wood, with store of
primitive household matters, with the sleeping-mats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
spread. They turned and saw the great sea and the
sky wide and deep. The evening wind, too, had
arisen and caressed them, blowing richly and
strongly. A tall palm tree rose from clean white
sand. They sat beneath this while the stars came
shining forth, and that of which they spoke was
Love.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">FOUR YEARS</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">No</span> Spaniards came to be driven back, had Aderhold
been that magician who could do it. It was like a
lost island, or the first peopled island, or the last. Day
after day they watched a tranquil sea and saw no
point of any sail. Time passed. The Indians from
the great island ceased to dream of recapture. Joan
and Aderhold ceased to dream of being taken,
wrenched apart; ceased to dream of the open boat
and of the Silver Queen and of the prison and the
gallows field. They did not cease to dream of Hawthorn,
of Heron’s Cottage and the Oak Grange, of
Hawthorn Forest, and all the life that lay on yonder
side the prison gates. Joan dreamed of her father
and of her uncle the huntsman, of the castle and
Mistress Borrow and others there, the town as once
it had been to her, and of Hawthorn as once it had
been. She dreamed of Heron’s cottage—of every
item there—the well under the fruit trees, the bees
under the thatch, the daffodils and every later
flower, of her kitchen and the hearth and the old settle,
and her spinning-wheel. She dreamed of gathering
faggots in Hawthorn Forest. She dreamed of
Alison and of Will the smith’s son and of Goodman
Cole and of many another—the vintner in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
town, Cecily Lukin and the forester’s wife, old
Master Hardwick—many another. But all were
blended together in a dream world, in a gay and
bright picture-book, where if there were witches they
were harmless good souls who rather helped people
than otherwise, and where no one was persecuted for
thinking things out for one’s self. In the picture
book it seemed almost a laudable thing to do. Aderhold
dreamed—and his dream world was wider by
his greater range of this life’s experience. He
dreamed of Hawthorn and Hawthorn Forest and all
the roads thereabouts, of the Oak Grange and of
Heron’s cottage; but he dreamed likewise of a world
beyond Hawthorn. He dreamed of his own childhood
and boyhood, and they, too, had a picture-book
setting, where the rough became only rich and varied,
and what had seemed sorrow and harm turned an
unhurt side. He dreamed of his first manhood, and
of his search for knowledge, the sacred hunger and
thirst and the lamp of aspiration in his hand. He
dreamed of old woes and scars, happenings many
an one, persons many an one.... But neither he nor
Joan dreamed any more, with a frightful sense of
nearness, with a cold start of waking, of sudden,
clutching hands, of separation, of dark and deep
gaols where neither could hear the other’s voice, or if
the other’s voice was heard, indeed, then heard in a
long cry of anguish. Fear spread its dark wings and
left them, and took with it intensity of watchfulness
and all the floating motes that made its court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>They had now great strength and health, Joan’s
renewed, Aderhold’s such as it had never been.
They stood erect and bright-eyed, their movements
had rhythm, the hand went with precision to its
task, the glance fell unerringly, the foot bore them
lightly. They bent to life with a smile, frequently
with laughter. If life was always a mighty riddle, if
at times it seemed a vivid disaster, yet indubitably
there were stretches, as now, when it became a
splendid possession!</p>

<p class="pp6sq p1">“‘I have heard talk of bold Robin Hood,</p>
<p class="pp7">And of brave Little John,</p>
<p class="pp6">Of Friar Tuck and Will Scarlett,</p>
<p class="pp7">Locksley and Maid Marian—’”</p>

<p class="pn1">sang Joan. She wove as she sang, for there was
cotton for weaving, and she had learned of the Indian
women and greatly bettered their instruction.
She saw garments for them both, hanging from
the pegs, lying upon the shelves Aderhold had made.
She had traded her skill at many things for needles
of bone, for the vegetable dyes that the women used,
for various matters that she wanted. She was of all
women most fit for such a return to a younger world.
Sane and strong and skilled, with the artist arisen
from the mere workwoman, she turned back some
thousand years, and handled savage life with a creative
hand. On all sides latent power came forth. A
wise trader, she gathered what she needed; a good
teacher, she imparted knowledge as she went, without
ostentation, insensibly, with a fine unconsciousness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
a worker of the best, she did that which her
hand found to do with <i>élan</i> and precision and an
assured result upon which to base further results.
She lacked not for leisure either, nor for a whimsical,
sceptical glance upon her own labours, nor for
an ability to let it all slip aside while she sat and
brooded upon the open sea.</p>

<p>As for Aderhold, he was and was not the man of
the Oak Grange. He was that man freed where he
had been bound, fed where he had been starved.</p>

<p>Their domain grew in fitness and beauty. By the
time the perfect winter had passed into the languors
of spring, and spring into the heats and rains of summer,
and summer again into cooler, fairer days, they
had achieved about them an Arcadian right simplicity,
as far from meagreness as from excess. The
large hut, palm-thatched, stood in a well-stocked
garden. Great trees gave them shade; a spring of
clear water for ever a cooling, trickling sound.
Around all they planted a flowering hedge. Within
this round sounded the hum of their industries and
their own clear voices. Without was the eternal
voice of the sea, and in and out and around, the
voice of the moving air.</p>

<p>The murmur of the Indian village was likewise
there, but it did not come athwart; it travelled
equably with the other sounds. They had come to
have a fondness for the dwindling village, an affection
for this remnant of a remnant of a people.
They were poor savages, they had flaws and vices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
but save that they were less complex, less intertwined
with later offshoots, more plain stalk and
plain word, their flaws and vices differed in no great
wise from those that might be viewed in France or
England. At times the village seemed like a village
of children, and then again it might seem very old
and somewhat wise. Once or twice they had seen it
waver toward a village of beasts, heavily swaying toward
the animal only. But Aderhold had seen that
happen in France and Italy—they might both think
that they had seen it happen in England. On the
very morrow it was something more than animal.
At times it was something much more—something
much higher. And they knew that flaws and vices
lurked in themselves also—unplucked-out weeds
yet living a slow dark life in the backward-reaching
abyss. They understood the village, and they tried
to help. They did help, and by slow degrees the village
came to change affection with them. As for the
old chief, every other day he came to see them.</p>

<p>He was of an enquiring and speculative turn of
mind, and it was his wont to bring unsolved questions
to the vine-shaded strip of bare earth before
the hut, and there, seated on a mat with a few followers
squatted around, propound them to the two.
To most of the islanders all things, outside the narrowest
range, were supernatural. The old man’s
scope was wider, and the daring of his scepticism,
proportioned to his environment, would have qualified
him for a dungeon in most countries that Aderhold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
knew.... Here upon this island all was as a
sketch, a faint model and portent only of what, in
seventeenth-century Europe, had become enlarged,
filled in and solid. Generically it was the same; it
was but a question of degree of intensity and of
accretions. These Indians also held for an external
deity, so extruded, so external that steps—that
intermediaries—must be extruded to cover the
extruded space between, to reach the extruded Ear
and Mind. Moreover, they did not maintain this a
flowing process, but continually let the extrusions of
remote ancestors dam the stream. They had idols
whom certainly not even the old chief might with
impunity criticize. They had “Thou shalts” and
“Thou shalt nots” which were wise and might long
remain so, and those which had been wise and were
now meaningless, colourless, making neither for much
good nor much harm, and those which might once
have been wise but were now hurtful, and those
which never had been wise and grew in folly. They
had notions, dim, not as yet fearfully positive, of a
future life of reward or punishment, where they would
do without limit or term—throughout eternity,
indeed—that which, Indians upon this island, they
most liked to do in this present moment, or would
suffer, alike for ever, just those pains which at present
they acutely disliked. They placed great merit
in belief without question, obedience without discrimination,
and a prostrate attitude. They had extruded
Authority. Nothing had a proper motion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
its own, but everything was moved by something
else. The disclaimer of responsibility, of generic lot
and part, was general. The disinclination to examine
premises was supreme. They had found their
despot in Inertia.</p>

<p>But the old chief was exceptional. He was wary
and paid respect to taboos. That done, he loved to
talk. He brought to Aderhold questions such as, at
the dawn of philosophy, an intelligent barbarian
might have put to Thales or Anaximander. Aderhold
answered as simply and well as he might; where
he could not answer, said so. Now and then the
more active-minded of the old man’s escort brought
queries. Joan also listened and questioned. Aderhold,
answering, taught in terms of natural science
and a general ethic—very simply, for that, here,
was the only way....</p>

<p>But when the old chief and his followers had
gone away from the vine-clad porch, and the murmur
of the village came faintly across the evening,
when, their day’s labour done, they went down to
the sea, to the coral ledge or crescent of pale sand,
and lay there by the blue, unending water; or when,
night having fallen, they rested in the moonlight on
the black-and-white chequered ground beneath the
palms, they spoke more fully, shared more completely
the inner worlds. Love could not rest with
them in the physical. Freedom, dilation, redoubling,
rapid and powerful vibration, energy, colour,
music, all mounted from the denser to the rarer universe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
Their minds interfused, there came moments
when their spirits might seem one iridescent orb.
They were one, ... only the next instant to be exquisitely
different ... then to approach and blend
again. At such times they spoke in low tones, with
slow, rounded words, of the deepest waters where
their souls drank of which they had knowledge,
or they spoke not at all, having no need to....
At other times they talked of the past and the future
and the whole round world. Steadily they
learned of each other: Joan much from Aderhold,
Aderhold much from Joan.</p>

<p>They had lived here a year—they had lived here
more than a year. When they had lived here two
years, when they, no more than the Indians about
them, watched the horizon for any ship, when they
had ceased to dream of separation, change, and disaster,
when it was fully home, with the sweetness
and fragrance of home—then was born their child.</p>

<p>Joan lay upon the clean, woven mats in the bright
moonlight. Aderhold put the babe in her arms, then
stretched himself beside them. Her grey eyes opened
upon him. “Gilbert—Gilbert—I love you so—”</p>

<p>“I love you so—”</p>

<p>She took his hand and guided it with hers until it
rested upon the child, wrapped in cloth which she
had woven. “Life from life and added unto life,”
she said. “Love from love and added unto love.”</p>

<p>The child was a woman child, and they named her
Hope. She grew and thrived and they had great joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
in her. When the old chief came to see her, he held
her in his hands and gave her a musical name of his
own. They translated it, Bird-with-Wide-Wings.
Henceforward now they called her by this Indian
name and now they called her Hope. The old chief
grew fond of her, came oftener than ever, would sit
in sun or shade quite still and content beside the
cotton hammock in which she swung. The days
went by, the weeks, the months, and she continued
to thrive. She had Joan’s grey eyes, but save for this
she was liker Aderhold. She lay regarding them, or
laughed when they came toward her, or put out a
small hand to touch them; she was happy and well,
and they were glad, glad that she was on earth.</p>

<p>The hot season came and the rains, and in August
heavy storms. Trees were levelled and the frail huts
of the village suffered. The sea came high upon the
land and the rain fell in sheets. In the dim hut with
the door fast closed, Aderhold and Joan and the
babe rested in security. The babe slept; the two lay
and listened to the fury without.</p>

<p>“There comes into my mind,” said Joan, “the
black sky and the dead air and the lightning and
thunder that Sunday in Hawthorn Church.”</p>

<p>“It came to me then, too,” answered Aderhold.
“Some finger in this storm strikes the key.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Both saw Hawthorn Church
again and the congregation, and Master Clement in
the pulpit. Both felt again the darkness of that
storm, the oppression and the sense of catastrophe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
In mind again each, the remembered bolt having
fallen, left the church and took the homeward road.
Joan hurried once more over the sighing grass, past
the swaying trees, saw Heron’s cottage and the
breaking storm. Aderhold passed again through
Hawthorn Forest and crossed the stream before the
Oak Grange, reached again the fairy oak and the
Grange. He was again in Dorothy’s kitchen, stooping
over the fire—in his old room with his unfinished
book beneath his hand—upon the stairs—the
door was opening—the men to take him.... The
blast without the hut changed key. The babe woke,
and Joan, lifting her, moved to and fro. When she
was hushed and sleeping, the strong echo, the returned
emotion had disappeared. They kept silence
for a little, and then they talked, not of old things
but of the island, of their trees and garden and harm
from the hurricane that must be repaired, and then
of the village and the children of the village. They
were beginning now to teach these.</p>

<p>The storm passed and other storms. There came
around again the days of balm, the perfect weather.
The child Hope was a year old. Their joy in her was
great, indeed. For themselves, they were husband
and wife, lovers, friends, fellow scholars, fellow workers,
playmates. Their friendship with the Indians was
stronger by a year, their service stronger. The old
chief came often and often, and the child crowed and
laughed and clapped her hands to see him.</p>

<p>The balmy days, the perfect weather passed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
the spring passed. Summer again with its heats and
rains was here. With the first great storm, in the hut
with the door fast closed, shutting out the swaying
and the wind and the hot, rain-filled air, Joan, playing
with the little Hope, keeping her from being terrified
by the darkness and the rush of sound, suddenly
fell quite still where she knelt. She turned her
head; her attitude became that of one who was
tensely and painfully listening.</p>

<p>When she spoke it was with a strange voice.
“Does it come again to you as it did last year?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Aderhold; “it comes by force of association.
Dismiss it from your mind.”</p>

<p>“It comes as close as though it were going to be
real again.”</p>

<p>“It is the darkness and oppression and the feeling
of being pent. It will pass.—Look at the Bird-with-Wide-Wings!
She is laughing at us.”</p>

<p>The hurricane raved itself to a close; the light
came and the blue sky, the sun shone out. There followed
a week of this; then, one morning at sunrise,
Joan, coming out of the hut into the space beneath
the trees, looked seaward and uttered a cry. “Gilbert—Gilbert!”</p>

<p>Aderhold came to her side. “What is it?”</p>

<p>Her arm was raised and extended, the hand pointing.
A ship stood off the island.</p>

<p>All that day it was there; it hovered, as it were,
it reconnoitred. It sent out no boats, but there was
something that said that it had seen the village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
It came near enough, and the clearing would be
visible from the rigging. The Indians’ canoes, moreover,
were there upon the beach.... It was a ship
with dingy sails, with a bravo air, yet furtive, too.
Once it clapped on sail and dwindled to a flake, and
those who watched from out a screening belt of wood
thought that it was gone. But it seemed that it
meant only to sail around the island, for presently
the outlook in the tallest tree saw its shape, having
doubled a long point, enlarge again across this green
and silver spit. When the second morning dawned,
there it was again, dusky, ill-omened, riding the deep
water beyond the reef that somewhat guarded the
shore.... Then the air thickened, and there threatened
a hurricane. The ship turned and scudded
away. While the sky darkened, she vanished, sinking
beneath the horizon to the south.</p>

<p>The storm broke, reigned and passed. When it
was over, when, save for the myriad small wreckage
and the whitened and high-running sea, there was
calm again, then fell talk and discussion enough as
to that ship, foreboding enough, excitement enough
in the village. The Indians made new spears or tried
trusted old ones, sharpening afresh every point.
They had bows and arrows, though they put more
dependence in their spears, and in short hatchets,
headed with bits of sharpened rock. Whatever
weapons there were were got in order. That done, all
that they could do was done. Their not unhealthful
clime, their search for food, their fishing, swimming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
their games and ceremonial dances kept their bodies,
slight and not greatly muscular though they were,
yet in a condition of some strength and readiness.
Now they had only to wait.... They waited, but no
ship came back, nor other ships appeared.</p>

<p>The bad season passed, the good days came
around again, and still no fleck of a sail showed on
all the round of the blue ocean. The Indians ceased
to glance up continually from whatever employment
they were about. Now they looked not once a day,
now they ceased all active expectation, now the
matter grew dim, remote, now it faded almost from
mind. The old chief, perhaps, still looked seaward,
but the village at large had short memories when
immediate anxieties were lifted. Life took up again
the old, smooth measure.</p>

<p>But Aderhold and Joan could not forget. Subtly
they felt that the current was wearing another channel.
There were cloud shapes below the horizon.
They were happy. Their joy in each other and in the
child was, if that could be, deeper—the very shape
of fear gave an intensity, a lambent rose and purple,
a richer music—made it deeper. Their service to
the folk among whom they had fallen was no less....
But they felt a threat and a haunting and a
movement of life from one house to another.</p>

<p>At last, on a calm and glorious morning, they saw
the ship again—that ship and another. The two
lowered sail, down rattled the anchors; they swung
at ease in the still water beyond the fringing reef.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Their flags were Spanish; they sent a shot from a
culverin shrieking across to the land. It sheared the
top of a palm tree; the green panache came tumbling
to the ground. Birds rose with clamour and fled
away; the shot echoed from a low hill back in the
island. Forth from the ships’ sides put boats—boat
after boat until there were a number—and all filled
with armed men.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SPANIARDS</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">The</span> slave-seekers, one hundred and fifty armed
men, struck a flag into the earth before the village
and demanded a parley. Their leader or captain was
a tall, black-bearded person, fierce and fell of voice
and aspect. He came to the front and shouted to the
Indians in a mixture of Spanish and Indian words.
Also he made friendly-seeming gestures. “No harm
meant—no harm meant! Friends—friends! Your
kindred send you messages—from a happy country—much
happier than here where you live! Let us
come into your village and talk.—We have beads
and scarlet cloth—”</p>

<p>But the village kept silence. At Aderhold’s instigation,
immediately after the ship’s first visit, it had
digged around itself a shallow ditch and planted in
part a stockade of sharpened stakes, in part a tall
and thorny hedge. Within this manner of wall were
gathered some four hundred souls, counting men,
women, and children. Besides the infants and the
small boys and girls there were the old and infirm
and the sick. All were naked of other defence than
this one barrier and the frail, booth-like walls of
their huts. They were armed only with primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
weapons. The word “Spaniard” meant to them
ogre and giant.</p>

<p>If they were not truly ogres and giants, the slave-seekers
were yet active, hardened, picked men,
trained in cruelty, practised in wiles, fired with lust
of the golden price. When the village held silent,
the leader tried again with blandishments; when
there came no answer but the hot sunshine and the
murmur of wood and sea, the company lifted its
flag and advanced with deliberation. From behind
the wall came a flight of spears and arrows. A Spaniard
staggered and fell. Some savage arm, more sinewy
than most, had sent a spear full through his
neck. There arose a roar of anger. The men from
the ships, the black-bearded one at their head,
rushed forward, came tilt against the stockade and
the thorn hedge.... They had not believed in the
stoutness of any defence, nor of these Indians’ hearts.
But driven back, they must believe. Carrying with
them their wounded, they withdrew halfway to the
sea and held council.</p>

<p>In the village they mended the gaps in the wall of
stakes and thorny growth, and that done, watched
and waited. The sun rode high, the children went
to sleep.... The old chief—the fighting men, the
women gathered around him—talked with high,
ironic passion of days gone by in this island, in this
island group. “They came, and our fathers’ fathers
thought they were gods or men like gods! They
had their wooden cross, and they planted it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
sand, side by side with their flag that says ‘Slay!’
They said that both were pleasing to the Great
Spirit, and that they were his favoured children.
They went away and our fathers’ fathers thought
of them as gods and their country as the house of
the Great Spirit.... They who had been children
when they came grew to be men. There were men
and men, then, in this land, men and men! Then
the Spaniards came again. They told our fathers
that they came from heavenly shores. They said
that there, would our fathers only go with them in
their many ships, they would find their dead again!
Find them living and bright and always young.
Find them they loved. Find their forefathers whom
the Great Spirit loved and kept always about him.
Find all they dreamed about. Find happiness....
They were weak of mind and they believed! They
went into the Spaniards’ ships—hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds. Next year the Spaniards
came again and they brought what they said were
messages from the red men who had gone last year
to the heavenly shores. It was truly where the Great
Spirit dwelt and where the dead lived again and all
the red men who could should come.... And they
whose islands these were were weak in judgment and
listened and believed and went. The Spaniards carried
them away in their ships—men and men and
men and women and children. They loaded their
ships with them as though they were nuts or fruit
or fish they had caught, or the gold that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
always seeking. They carried them away, and next
year they came for more. They took these too. And
now this country was growing as it is to-day—trees
where once there were people. But at last one escaped
from the ‘heavenly shores,’ and after long
toil and suffering reached these islands and told
the truth. So at last when the Spaniards came the
people fought them. But they were strong and the
people were weak. And more and more trees grew
where once there had been men! Now”—said the
old chief—“I will tell you about those heavenly
shores, for I, too, have been there. I will tell you of
what we from this country do there, and what is
done to us.” He told, circumstantially, a tale of
fearful suffering.</p>

<p>Many of the Indians, men and women alike, determined
to die rather than be taken. But many,
and perhaps the most, were neither strong nor stoic,
and there was a doubt, Aderhold and Joan felt, and
the old chief felt.... Neither that day nor that
night did there befall another attack. The Spaniards
camped upon the shore, but the watching village
saw boats go to and fro between the land and
the ships. The night was dark and they saw moving
lanterns. With the dawn one of the ships slowly
felt her way farther into the crooked channel; when
she anchored again she lay much nearer than before,
and her row of culverins grinned against the village.
Moreover, three lesser pieces had been dismounted
and brought ashore. In the night-time they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
made a platform and mounted these falcons or
sakers.</p>

<p>As the sun rushed up, they sent a broadside
against the wall and the huts beyond. The flame
and thunder terrified, the iron shot wrought havoc.
They sent another round, tore a great gap in the
hedge, then with a shout charged, the whole company,
across the open strip.... The bravest of the
village fought desperately, but the breach was made.
Many of the assailants were partly mailed. The Indians’
weapons turned against steel headpieces and
backs and breasts. The Spaniards’ pikes and cutlasses
had advantage; their strength and ruthless
practice had advantage; their name, their face, their
voice carried terror to these forest people. Yet they
fought, the braver sort striking twice—for themselves
and for those whose joints were as water. The
old chief grew young again. His eyes breathed fire;
he fought and he cried his people on with a great,
chanting voice.... A turn in the confused struggle
brought the black-bearded Spaniard facing Aderhold
and Joan. “Mother of God! What’s here?
White skins leading these devils and fighting against
us? Flay you alive—”</p>

<p>Men drove between. There was a great noise, a
panting heat, a rocking and swimming of all things
before the eyes. A crying arose. Unlooked for,
suddenly, there had been sent ashore from the
ships the final numbers of their crew and company.
Thirty fresh assailants poured with shouts and lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
weapons through the broken defences.... The
fearful among the Indians, and those who thought
slavery better than death, threw down whatever
weapons they bore and made gestures of submission
and entreaty. Others were overpowered. There
were many who could not fight—the sick, the infirm,
and aged, many children. The terror of these
and their wailings weakened the hearts of those who
did fight. Moreover, the Spaniards knew what to do.
They took a child and threw it from pike point to
pike point, and found Indian words in which to
threaten a like fate to every babe. The Indian
mothers cried out to fight no more.</p>

<p>The slave-seekers came in mass against those who
yet struggled. They cut down the old chief, fighting
grimly; they ran him through the body with a pike
and slew him. Aderhold and Joan with others, men
and women, fought before a hut in which had been
placed a number of children. A Spaniard came
behind Aderhold and struck him down with a blow
upon the head. He lay for a minute stunned; when
his senses cleared all was over. All were beaten
down, cowed, disarmed. Hands would have seized
Joan. She fought them off, sprang into the hut
and caught up her child, then, with her in her arms,
came back to Aderhold’s side....</p>

<p>The victors were accustomed to victory. The
fighting over, the business conducted itself according
to custom. This affair differed only from many
others in that there had been a resistance of unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
firmness. Victory had not been without hurt,
without, even, the loss of Spanish lives. Business,
reacting, conducted itself therefore with something
less of contemptuous and careless disregard of pain
inflicted and something more of vindictive willingness
to inflict it. The conquered were driven together
and stripped of every belonging which, by any
ingenuity, might be converted into a weapon either
against their masters or their own now wretched
lives. The black-bearded captain told off guards,
and beside pike and cutlass the lash appeared....
The ships were to be furnished fruit and cassava
cakes and the casks filled with water. The already
slaves were set to the task. Graves must be dug for
the Spanish dead, and these the slaves dug. Their
own dead went unburied. The black-bearded man
walked in front of the rows of captives and with a
jerk of his thumb indicated the too badly wounded,
the sick who would not survive the voyage, the too
old. These they put away with sword or dagger or
pike thrust. The children were to go—healthy children
had value. At last he came to Aderhold and
Joan. He stood still before them, looked them up
and down, his beard bristling. “Spanish?” he said.
“No, no! I think not!—English, then? English—English—English!
How did you come here?”</p>

<p>“Through shipwreck.”</p>

<p>“You taught them to fight us. English—English—English!
Well, we shall see, English!—Are you
heretics?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you mean are we of the English Church, we
are not of the English Church.”</p>

<p>“English have no church. There is only one
church and religion. Are you of the Holy Catholic
Church and Religion?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the black-bearded man and spat
toward them, “I will take you as a present to those
who are.”</p>

<p>He stood off and regarded them. Joan with the
child sat on the earth, in the hot sunlight. The
child’s terrified crying had hushed; in her mother’s
arms she had sobbed herself to sleep. She lay half
covered by Joan’s skirt, shadowed by her mother’s
bending breast and face. The Spaniard’s countenance
twisted until it was like a gargoyle’s for cruelty
and ungenial mirth. Without a word he stooped
and with one great slashing stroke of his dagger slew
the child....</p>

<p>They bound Joan, and she lay at last, prostrate
upon the earth, her forehead touching the child’s
still feet. Aderhold sat beside the dead and the
living love.... Around was heat and glare, huge
suffering, brute indifference, brute triumph, life
brought low, life iron-shod trampling life, a battlefield
of instincts, a welter of emotions, tendencies in
impact, old and deep ideas opposed to ideas ...
and all with which he and Joan were ranged in time
and space,—their stream and current—here and
now, as often before and often to come, the loser,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
the loser drowning in defeat.... He felt the wide
cold, the check, the bitter diminishing, felt it impersonally
for the enormous current, the stream where
there were so many drops; then, because he was man,
felt it for this childish people, felt it, a bitter and
overwhelming tide, for himself and Joan. Woe—woe—there
was so much woe in living....</p>

<p>All the rest of that day the enslaved brought food
and rolled casks of water for the ships. When night
came they were let to sleep, lying on the ground,
in a herd. Now and again through the darkness rose
a sharp cry of grief, or ran from one to another a
sobbing and groaning. But the most slept heavily,
without movement. Dawn came, and the slaves
were roused. They were permitted to eat a little
food—and then they were driven to the shore and
into the boats.... Their dead, their village, their
island were severed from them. They were left
naked to the beating of new tides....</p>

<p>Joan and Aderhold were put upon the ship with
the darker sails—the ship that had come first to
the island. The hold of this ship was inexpressibly,
fearfully crowded with the enslaved. When the
hatches were closed, it was a black pit, a place of
gasping, fighting for breath. When morning came
the Spaniards, seeing that otherwise much of their
property would die and become no man’s property,
drew out several score and penned them in a narrow
space upon the deck. Aderhold and Joan were
brought forth with the others, driven here with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
them, pressed by the mass close against the ship’s
side.</p>

<p>Day crept away, sunset came. The island where
they had dwelled was long fallen from sight. Out of
the sea before them, though as yet at some distance,
rose the shape of an outermost islet of this group.
When that should be passed, there would lie an
expanse of ocean, and, at last, driving south, would
rise the great island to which they were bound. The
sun dipped below the horizon, but over against it
rose the round and silver moon. By its light could
be seen the strengthening outline of the last island,
at length the very curve of surf, the beach and
sombre palms.</p>

<p>Aderhold moved, touched Joan who sat as if in a
trance. About them many of the Indians had fallen
asleep or lay, beaten down to a half-consciousness.
At no great distance were the guards. But these
had no fear now of that cowed shipload, and so paid
little attention. Amidships and forward were Spaniards
enough, but these talked and swore or gamed
among themselves or gazed at the island without
lights by which they were slipping. Aderhold bent
and whispered in Joan’s ear. For a moment she
sat motionless; then slowly the mind returned and
became active, though through dark veils of woe.</p>

<p>She nodded. “Yes, yes! Let us go! If we die we
may find her.”</p>

<p>“Wait until that cloud is between us and the
moon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>It came between and the ship and the decks darkened.
The two rose with caution to their feet. About
them were darkness, shadowy forms, blended sounds,
but no eye seemed to see what they were about, no
voice cried out an alarm. They were close to the
ship’s side—one other moment and they had
swung themselves up, leaped overboard.... They
touched the dark water, went under, rose, struck
out. In their ears rang no shout or sound of discovery.
The sucking and turmoil of the water about
them lessened. A fresh wind was blowing and the
ship sailed swiftly. She was no longer huge above
them, they came out of her shadow; she was seen at
a slight distance, then at a greater and a greater....
They were free of her, free also of her consort,
the other ship. The wide ocean swept around.</p>

<p>It swept around save where the island rose. It
rose not at all far away, a quiet and lonely strand.
A light surf broke upon its shore. Sometimes floating,
sometimes swimming, the two who would yet
have life gained toward it. They gained toward it
until at last they reached it, came out of the beating
surf, and lay with closed eyes and fluttering breath
upon the moonlight-coloured sand.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ISLET</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">This</span> was a small island or cay. They found water
and they found fruit and cassava, and with these
and a shelter of boughs and leaves of the little palm
they raised again the flag of life....</p>

<p>The death of the child. For a time that made of
existence a cruel buffet, a sore bruise. The parents
grieved. But time dealt with that grief—time
and inner strength. At length it diffused itself, adding
its own hue to many-tinted consciousness, its
own strain to life’s vast orchestration, but no longer
darkening and making to throb all moments of the
waking day. They had within them a coördinating,
harmonizing power, and sorrow brought its
own wealth and added to the whole.</p>

<p>The outward activities of life narrowed, indeed,
upon this islet. But here also they took circumstance
and enlarged its bounds and deepened its
meaning. They brought will and intellect to bear
upon environment, moulded it as far as might be
and increased their havings. Here nor nowhere in
this universe could they be less than interested.
Flotsam upon this islet, yet here as elsewhere the
mind found food and field of action and through
small doorways passed into wide countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>Love burned clear, love of man and woman. It
kept its heyday. But beside it rose, higher and more
massive than in the peopled, busy island, other
ranges of the mind. The child’s death—and the
loss of the Indian village and of the old chief and the
recurring vision of that oppression and the inhumanity
of their kind—and the deep loneliness of this
place—all wrought upon them. Moreover, the
spring of inward growth was strong and constant.
Year by year, with Joan as with Aderhold, the spirit
travelled further in all its dimensions.</p>

<p>The mind.... Here upon this span of earth the old
ache for knowledge, the old brooding and longing of
the mind came back to Aderhold, came more imperiously,
larger, wider-robed. This ball of earth and
the criss-cross of movement upon it. This sun and
the chain that held to it the ball of earth. What
was the chain? These stars and clouds of stars—this
sea of ether—light in waves.... Again, the
growth of plants—motion fluent as a stream. And
the life that dwelt in shells—that made its armour
and outgrew it.... Ceaseless change, transition,—kinds
linked by likeness to other kinds, kinds
growing out of other kinds, the trunk branching.
He thought that all kinds might have branched from
one or few, and the selfsame sap in all. He did not
believe in a myriad unconnected, arbitrary creations....
But if the least leaf and tendril knew
motion, alteration, growth, then the sap, too, knew
it—the sap that was supposed to be so moveless, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
perfected.... Kin and kin again—one and one
again.</p>

<p>As for Joan—her mind trod differing roads,
though with many a point of contact, many an inn
where she met him who travelled too. As of Heron’s
cottage her hands and head had wrought a bright
pastoral, an unfrayed and well-woven garment of
life—as in the peopled island she had with a larger
and a freer play, with a more creative and a nobler
touch, made life not an idyll only, but an idyll and
something more, so here she lived a nobler poem.
Her child’s death brought into it deeper tones, as of
an organ, as of violins. And as she had lit torches
for Aderhold, so had he lit torches for her. She
thought and imaged with a wider sweep than had
once been possible. She thought and imaged now
for the whole world; she dreamed light for all.</p>

<p>To both the time upon this isle was a time of deepening
vision, of a crescent sense of inward freedom
and power. To a stranger’s chance-lighting eye they
would have seemed but two castaways, narrowly
environed, scantly living, lonely and lost, of necessity
wretched. They were not wretched, or lonely,
or lost.</p>

<p>Months passed—the year—a great part of another
year. Then one day again they saw a sail....
It was the beginning of the stormy season, and there
had been rough weather. To-day the sky was blue,
the air but gently moving, but there had been a gale
to drive ships and make wrecks. This ship had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
been greatly hurt, but the winds had driven her out
of her course. Moreover, there had been leakage
among her water-casks. It was with joy that she
saw this islet lift upon the horizon. She made it,
found a large-enough harbour, between two horns of
coral rock and sand, and presently sent her longboat,
filled with seamen, to the shore. They rowed in cautiously,
keeping a good lookout, for, while it was but
an islet and looked desert, there might be Indians or
pirates or Spaniards. No harm showing, they made
a landing and came upon the shore.—It was now to
search for water.</p>

<p>In the search they found a palm-thatched hut,
and, standing expectant before it, a white man and
woman.—“Who be you?” demanded the boatswain
in good Devon.</p>

<p>The ship was the Eagle, sailing home from Virginia,
having brought out colonists and supplies.
Now it was taking home samples of native products,
two or three Indians for show, and not a few dissatisfied
adventurers, with others of a stouter make
who were bound with representations to the Company
or upon various upgathering missions.... Who
were the white man and woman? They were Giles
and Ellice Heme, shipwrecked here several years
ago. The captain, who presently came ashore, was
questioning them. From London? Aye, then! and
their ship? The Needs Must, sailing from port of
London. The captain rubbed his brows. He did not
remember the ship or the loss of her, but then more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and more ships were going out, and he could not remember
all names or accidents. All lost? Giles and
Ellice Heme could not tell. They had escaped in a
small boat. Those with them had died.—Would
they be taken back to England?—The captain was a
bluff old sea-dog, literal-minded and not inquisitive.
He assumed that their tale was true in the main,
and he assumed that, of course, they wished to be
taken back to England. Otherwise, there would be
something wrong with them. He hardly waited for
an answer, but turned eyes and mind toward the
water-casks. He was in haste; he wished to up sail
and away while the sky was still without clouds.</p>

<p>The two, left alone at last after all exclamation
and question, faced a decision—how momentous
an one made itself felt between them. They stood
in the brown light of their hut, the doorway framing
blue sea and sky and the Eagle, quivering to be
gone.</p>

<p>Aderhold spoke. “If we refused to go, it is most
likely—it is certain, I think—that they would
force us with them. We should be thought mad—or
if not that, they would hold that we were not
simply castaways. They would take us still, and
from the first we should rest under suspicion.”</p>

<p>“At any time the Spaniards may come again,”
said Joan; “then again horror ... death. Or some
other harm may come to one of us here—and the
other left alone. That is often in my mind, and I
know that it is often in yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we reached England unsuspected—if we
could lose ourselves in London—”</p>

<p>“Never could we go back to Hawthorn—nor to
the town!”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Six years.... Gilbert, would we not be safe
anywhere else?”</p>

<p>“Ours are matters in which no one is safe who
thinks not as his neighbours. And say we slipped
silent and down-bent through life, giving no present
authority offence—yet at some corner comes one
who recognizes face or voice and recalls the past—’Ha,
you hide!’ And it is all to do again.... I do
not think we have any choice. I do not think this
captain will leave us here.... There have been
men who, under feigned names and away from the
place of blackest threatening, have lived long and
peacefully.... At first, until we were free of enquiries
and had found work by which we might live,
there would be thick danger.... We might escape.”</p>

<p>“It is best to be with your kind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is best. The world grows so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to see green grass and English flowers!...
But the child—the child! We would go farther
and farther from where the child lies.... I know
that we must go.”</p>

<p>“Yes. She does not lie there. She does not stay
there.”</p>

<p>“No—she is here—she is everywhere....
Well, let us go bravely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>Giles and Ellice Herne went aboard the Eagle.
Before sunset she had clapped on all sail and was
moving swiftly from that island. It faded, faded.
They lost the clump of palm trees marking the place
of their hut, lost the outline of the tiny harbour,
lost in the dusk the gleam of the beach and the white
crests of the incoming tide. The Eagle was a good
ship and a swift sailer. Back she came into her
course. The bird that was her figurehead looked
east, looked north, between it and its homing the
grey and rolling Atlantic. Now she had bad weather
and now she had good, but the good predominated.</p>

<p>The ship was not crowded, as had been, six years
before, the Silver Queen. Moreover, those aboard
were preoccupied, the dissatisfied with their dissatisfaction,
the hardier, more patient or farseeing
sort, returning to England only to return thence to
their new world, with their papers of representation,
their arguments, and busy schemes. At first there
was curiosity as to the castaways and how they
had preserved life, alone, on that morsel of land.
That satisfied, attention turned in each on board
to his own matters, or to matters that seemed
cognate. The rescued were quiet folk who kept to
themselves; doubtless they were dazed by long privation
and loneliness, and by this unexpected salvation....</p>

<p>Aboard were several women, the captain’s wife,
and one or two others of the bolder sort who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
go with their husbands to whatever new worlds
might be discovered. These helped Joan to fitter
clothing than any she possessed. She came back to
Aderhold in a linsey kirtle and bodice, a small white
cap, and with a kerchief folded across her bosom.
“Hawthorn again,” she said with a sob in her
throat. He, too, had been given clothing. He was
dressed plainly, like a clerk. No one was by, the
soft dusk closing in. They stood for a moment and
within them rose the vivid shape of the past. They
smelled again the fern and mould of Hawthorn
Forest; they heard again the drone of the bees, the
singing of the stream past the fairy oak; they heard
again the distant church bells. Rose the great
image, grave and golden, of the six years past, rose
the vision of the child, rose old memories, tendernesses,
fears, rose forebodings, prophecies, realizations.
It was dusk, the wind making a low, sustained
music. They came to each other’s arms, they embraced
closely, straining each to each with passion.
They kissed, the tears stood in the eyes, fell
upon the cheeks of each. It was like a farewell,
and it was like a meeting....</p>

<p>Upon the ship was a man neither young nor old,
who had come out to Virginia the year before, sent
by the Company upon some investigation. Now,
the work done, he was returning. He had a strong,
determined face, steady eyes and a close-shutting
mouth. On the day of their coming aboard, he with
others had approached Giles and Ellice Herne and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
asked them questions. They had been true questions;
he was interested in knowing how they got
upon that island, but preferred the detail of how
they had managed to live while there. After that,
with some frequency he sought them out and fell
into talk. The rest upon the ship were preoccupied
with the struggles and miseries and triumphs of the
Colony. To them it was growing to be home. But
the Company’s agent, his errand done, was returning
to England like Antæus to Mother Earth. He
must talk, and guided by some subtle principle of
choice, he talked to these people who also must be
homesick for England.</p>

<p>The two strove to be guarded, spoke little themselves,
passed well enough for a quiet clerk or
scrivener or teacher and his wife whom the whimsical
fortunes of the time had made colonists, and
wind and wave and ill chance castaways on that
islet. Wisdom made them not too silent, not to
seem morosely so—nor too guarded, not to make it
evident that they were watching from behind barricades.
It was chiefly to Aderhold that he talked,
Joan sitting by, her hands clasped in her lap, her
eyes upon the sea, narrowing between them and
England. He talked, it seemed to Aderhold, with
boldness, but then the castaway gathered that upon
the issues that interested this man, men in England,
in six years’ time, had grown bolder.</p>

<p>News from England! News of England when the
agent left England last year was the already two-years-old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
news that the king meant to rule without
Parliaments. Perhaps when they landed in London
they might find newer news—perhaps the king,
wanting money very badly, had wanted it enough
at last to summon a Parliament. If that were so, the
agent of the Company hoped that certain men had
seats. He mentioned among others John Pym.
News! There was the news that the Bishops were
in the saddle. Episcopacy had been established in
Scotland. Timid and recreant ministers had gone
over, the patriotic were in hiding,—proscribed.
The people were at the mercy of the wolves—the
Crown’s wolves. In England just as bad—though
with a difference. The Established Church rode
high and kissed the hand of the king. “Passive
obedience!” It had got its shibboleth. “No power
in the people and disordered multitude.”—God’s
own hand having touched the forehead of kings!
“Did I not tell ye?” says the king; and with one
hand puts down the civil courts and with the other
lifts the ecclesiastical.</p>

<p>News! The news from England was Despotism
that barked like Cerberus out of three mouths—King,
Bishops, and Favourites! The agent’s face
turned red and the veins in his forehead stood out,
so in earnest and angry was he. “News of England!”
he said, “is that slaves will be slaves and
free men will be free men! News of England is
that if things better not there will be battles!” He
swung round upon Aderhold. “I speak more plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
than I should! But if I can read men, your passion,
too, is for freedom!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Aderhold, “I would be free.”</p>

<p>Another time, when for some minutes they had
been watching the sea in silence, the determined-faced
man spoke with sudden energy. “Do you not
hold that the Presbyterian or Calvinist form of
religion and the rule of the people—such as are
landowners and tend neither to Popery on the one
hand nor to any manner of disbelief on the other—through
Parliaments duly chosen is the way of
God upon earth?”</p>

<p>Aderhold kept silence, his eyes upon the moving
sea. When he spoke at last it was almost dreamily.
“The only way?... Do you?”</p>

<p>Something in the fast-flowing field, the field that
was but the surface of depth, or in the mist-veiled
sky, or in the tone of the castaway, checked the
other’s reply. At last he said slowly, “It is right to
resist a king who would rule us beyond what the
sense of man allows.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Aderhold, “that is right.”</p>

<p>“That is what I care for,” said the agent; “that
is the way of God to me. The bishops go with the
king and preach tyranny, so the bishops are to be
fought too. He who wishes to be free surely will not
chain his will to the Pope’s throne. So what is there
left but Calvin—if you exclude these mad Independents
who spring up like mushrooms! At any
rate, in England to-day the men who oppose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
king’s tyranny are like to smack of Edinburgh or
Geneva!”</p>

<p>“In a manner I believe that to be true,” said
Aderhold. “Not yet do they wish freedom around
and around. But never will I deny that it is much
to begin to image freedom!”</p>

<p>The ship sailed on through good and bad weather.
To the two castaways danger seemed to sleep. No
one troubled them on this ship, preoccupied with its
own affairs. The fact that they were seen with the
agent of the Company procured for them a certain
respect. The days slipped by, the weeks slipped by—pearl-grey
weeks, quiet, halcyon.</p>

<p>There came a summer eve when, hand in hand,
Joan and Aderhold watched England rise from out
the sea. None was by. They stood long in silence;
then, “Do you remember,” said Joan in a low voice,
“how we ran through the castle wood with the great
moon on high? How we lay in that pit with the
branches over us while they that hunted us went by?
Do you remember the woman with the three daughters
who gave us bread and milk?”</p>

<p>“I remember it all,” said Aderhold. “May we
come forth now as then!... The smell of the hay
there in the barn where we lay all day.... The
white road that first night from the prison and the
starry sky over the gallows tree.”</p>

<p>“Over the gallows tree!”</p>

<p>“Once I thought a thing like that the fearfullest
thing! Now, though I love life more now than I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
then, I do not think so. The old terrors grow smaller.
They will come one day, I think, to cause laughter.”</p>

<p>“I understand that,” said Joan. “Nor do they
matter to me as they did. Neither the gallows tree,
nor words like witch and sorcerer, heretic and
atheist!”</p>

<p>The shore before them grew in distinctness, grew
and grew as they stood there alone, withdrawn,
watching. With that increasing definiteness, that
rigour of line and hue and shape, came with a growing
form, a growing sharpness of menace, came as it
had not come to them before upon this ship, a realizing
knowledge that here there was no change; that
the hot ploughshares and the sharp swords were yet
ready laid for folk like them to move across! England
was England still.... They heard upon the
wind, “<i>Witch and Sorcerer—Witch and Sorcerer—doubly
damned for that you were judged and lay not
still under our judgement! Witch and Sorcerer....
Fornicators—for in what church were read your marriage
banns, and what priest with lifted hands blessed
your union?... Blasphemers, deniers, atheists who
pray not to Jehovah! Witch and Sorcerer—Witch and
Sorcerer</i>—”</p>

<p>They were not wholly free from fear and shrinking.
They looked at each other with whitened faces. But
they had said true when they had said that they
were freer. They recovered, they smiled into each
other’s eyes. “I wonder how much of us they will
hang or burn—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>The shores grew plainer, higher. There came, suddenly,
a summons to the captain. They found him
in the great cabin, papers upon the table. Still short
of speech, incurious and literal, he now had duties
which he would perform. He had to give account to
the proper officers of the Eagle’s voyage and of those
whom she brought into England, and he proposed
not to lose sight of the castaways, Giles and Ellice
Herne, until the right authorities gave him quittance.
He could not remember the Needs Must,
but there were many who would. Any saved from
any lost ship had an importance, for they could give
to her owners information where had been guessing.
Therefore the captain meant to send the two ashore
with a trusted man who would take them before
such and such persons in authority. There they
would be questioned, and if they answered to satisfaction
would doubtless be helped. The captain,
with a wave of his hand dismissing them, turned to
other business. He left a sharp enough thorn of
anxiety with the two who had fled England on the
Silver Queen.</p>

<p>Night passed. Morning broke—English summer,
soft and sweet. Here was the Thames mouth, here
other winged ships and ships at anchor, here the
green shores, the waving trees, the clustered houses,
here England—England!</p>

<p>As they stood watching with full hearts the agent
of the Company came to them from the poop deck.
“You have no money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Have you friends in London?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>He held out to Aderhold a woolen purse, open,
showing two gold nobles and some silver pieces.
“Yes, take it—and no need for thanks! I have gotten
good from you.—You will want work?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I have weight enough with the Company to get
you a clerkship.”</p>

<p>Aderhold thanked him again, and with warmth of
feeling, but shook his head. He had plans, he said.—But
when the agent was gone the two smiled at
each other. Gold and plans!... They had had
plans—they had planned. What they had planned
was to lose themselves, immediately upon leaving
the ship, in the crowd which doubtless would gather
at the waterside, then to slip into some street or
lane and begone. Somewhere in the tangled heart of
London, in some poor street, in some garret, they
might find a lodging. Then work to live by....
There had risen a vision, not unhomely, comforting,
hopeful—physician’s work among the poor and
obscure, sempstress or spinster’s work, quiet life in
the shadow but with gleams of sun.... But now
the plans seemed hardly even gossamer.</p>

<p>The Eagle came slowly into port. Aboard was
bustle and confusion. With the rattling down of her
anchor appeared the small boats, the wherries,
clamouring to take all ashore. A barge brought port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
officers. These came up the side.... All was well,
all might go ashore. The agent of the Company
would go, it seemed, in the port barge. Giles and
Ellice Herne watched him leave the ship. He had
been a friend; they felt gratitude and liking; they
watched the dwindling boat and thought it doubtful
if, in this round of life, they would ever see the agent
again....</p>

<p>Their time came—they were to go with the
second mate, a broad-shouldered, surly, watchful
man.</p>

<p>The catch into which they stepped was crowded
with the lesser sort of the Eagle’s passengers. Here
were the dissatisfied, returning folk, and here with
their exploiter were the Indians brought for show.
Aderhold, looking at them, had a fleeting thought
of a booth, paused before on a morning when he
had set out northward from London, years ago....
Shipping loomed about them, Thames side before
them. The high, narrow houses, the roofs, the windows,
the roaring streets, the throng about the water
steps, pushing and jostling for a sight of the disembarking—talking
and shouting, people greeting
and being greeted, a swarm and distraction! Joan
sat elbow on knee, hand pressed against lips, her
eyes wide, and, as far as Thames side was concerned,
unseeing. What else she saw she did not say,
but her face had a soft and brooding look.... The
catch made its landing. Joan and Aderhold, placed
in the stern, were the last to come out upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
water stairs. Before them the second mate shouldered
his way. About them was the English crowd,
beneath their feet soil of England. Home—home—home
where they were born!</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HOUR-GLASS</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">They</span> were moving with the second mate through a
busy street, toward a harsh old pile of buildings.
The mate was a watchful man. To start aside from
him into some court or lane or other street, to elude
him and vanish, was from the start a clearly hopeless
thing. Did they try it he would raise a hue and cry.
They went with him in silence, watching Fate to see
what she would do.</p>

<p>The street was narrow, the houses dark, and high,
with overhanging storeys, with swinging signs.
Above showed only one pale stripe of sky. There
were booths and shops, with an occasional stentor
crying of “What d’ye lack?—What d’ye lack?”
Many people went up and down—type after type
that Aderhold recalled. The years since he had been
in London had made no great difference. He thought
that he discerned more party men—in many a
greater stiffness of bearing, a darker hue and plainer
cut in apparel. The chance words and phrases
caught in passing had an interest....</p>

<p>In old, old days there had come to him at times
of crisis, a detachment, an awareness of impersonality,
a perception that, actor here, he was no less
spectator of his action, safe in further space and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
time. The perception returned, and came with
greater strength than ever before, and with it, too,
an old sense of deepening light. He turned his face
toward Joan beside him.... She was gazing upon
London town, her grey eyes calm and bright, her lips
parted, rose colour in her cheeks. In a manner she
looked as young, as free from care and danger as
when, on a holiday, Joan Heron had come with her
father from the huntsman’s house in the castle wood
and had strolled here and there and to and fro in the
town six miles from Hawthorn. She looked as young
and like a girl, and yet the next moment there moved
beside him the woman, the mind and soul that had
grown. But the calmness held, the bright stillness,
the manner of radiance. She put out her hand and
touched Aderhold’s. “Do you feel it?—I felt only
fear this morning, but now, somehow, I do not believe
that I shall ever feel fear again. The things
that were so great have become little.”</p>

<p>The early morning had been clear, but the sky,
overcast when they left the Eagle, was now darkening
rapidly. There came a silver dash of rain, increasing
to a downpour. With slanted bodies and
bent heads men and women hastened to shelter.
Some hurried on to destinations not so far away;
others, with farther to go, took present refuge under
overhanging eaves or in doorways. The rain fell with
a steady, rushing sound; the gutters began to fill
and overflow; the air grew dark and still. “Stand
by,” said the mate, “until the cloud empties!” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
three stepped under the cover of an antique porch,
so jutting from the building of which it made a part
that the street had been forced to bend. Others were
here before them, perhaps a dozen in all. Some were
citizens, three or four country or small town people,
viewing the sights of London. These had with them
for guide and showman some city friend.</p>

<p>The latter was speaking with distinctness, in a
cheerful and complacent voice. “This was one of the
old religious houses. Over yonder used to be a field
where in Queen Mary’s time they burned people.”</p>

<p>The country folk looked with interest, not at the
old religious house, but at the row of small buildings
where once had been the field.</p>

<p>One spoke. “Did you ever see a man or woman
burned?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the citizen. “It’s dying out. They
mostly hang people now.”</p>

<p>A man in a sad-coloured dress spoke with an
abrupt, harsh voice. “There are sins that you
should burn for. I believe not in your weak mercy.
What is good enough for God on High is good enough
for me. He burns sinners. If you do not believe in
burning sinners, you do not believe in God as shown
forth in his written Word.”</p>

<p>“I think witches should be burned,” said the citizen.</p>

<p>The first country speaker put in his word again.
“I saw one burned once when I was a young man!
She was a tall, fair wench, and when the flames went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
up around her she cried out only one thing to the
crowd of us watching. She cried it thrice. ‘When
you feel fire, feel what you have believed!’”</p>

<p>“What did she mean?” asked the citizen.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” answered the countryman.
“There’s been an outbreak of witches this summer!
They’re getting very bold in the North. If you hear
of one, the next day you hear of another. For one
thing, as soon as there’s known to be a witch abroad,
people are on the lookout—”</p>

<p>The downpour of rain had lessened into a shower.</p>

<p>“Make sail!” said the mate.</p>

<p>Leaving the porch, the three from the Eagle
moved on up the narrow street between the rain-washed
houses. They were now at no great distance
from their destination. As they walked the
two tried to hear the questions that would be put to
them and to frame answers.... But it was difficult,
difficult. In both the impulse that was gathering
strength, that was, as they both now began to perceive,
the destined conqueror, was the impulse still
to serve the truth. They were not fanatic, and they
loved life. But side by side with the recognition that
hardly, hardly could they escape, that they would
have to make a tissue of statements that could and
in all human likelihood would be disproved, streamed
stronger and stronger the distaste for that web of
misstatement, the liking for a plain relation of their
being and its acts. They were conscious of no ecstasy,
no hot, martyr enthusiasm, but direction was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
taken. With that deep inward movement came to
each a feeling of strengthened personality, of unison,
harmony....</p>

<p>The wet and glistening street, the houses, the
roofs, the sky, the people passing up and down,—the
windows, the signs—Before them they saw a
swinging tavern sign, painted and cut in the shape
of a great hourglass. The tavern had a wide window,
overhanging the street, and in the window, as
the three from the Eagle came in line with it, appeared
the ruddy, determined face of the agent of
the Company. He looked out upon the street from
which the rain had in great part driven the people;
saw and hailed his fellow voyagers.</p>

<p>“Well met, good folk! Whither away—”</p>

<p>The second mate told the port to which they were
making. The man in the window was a person of importance
to the Eagle and its seamen. The mate
spoke with deference, and was ready to listen when
the agent proposed that he and the two shipwrecked
folk enter the Hour-Glass and drink a cup of wine.
He knew that the agent had seemed to have a liking
for the castaways—and they were not precisely folk
under suspicion, but only to be, as it were, certified
for. The agent spoke again with a touch of authority,
and the mate said, “Very good, sir, and thank
you kindly! A few minutes won’t matter.”</p>

<p>The determined-faced man had the inn’s best
room and had it to himself. He welcomed into it
Giles and Ellice Herne, but left the mate in the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
room with the host and a command for what he
pleased to drink.</p>

<p>The mate spoke again. “I’m ordered, sir, not to
let the shipwrecked people out of my sight.”</p>

<p>“If you stay where you are you will see them still,”
said the agent. “There is but one door to this room,
and I leave it open.”</p>

<p>The room had a sanded floor, a table, and benches.
Outside the clouds were parting, and now a stormy
sunlight broke through the window. The street
began again to fill with people and their voices
came confusedly into the room. A drawer brought
wine.</p>

<p>“I frequent this inn,” said the agent. “Moreover,
by good luck, I find that a man whom I greatly desire
to see is in London and sleeps here at the Hour-Glass.
I await him now, and in the mean time lack
entertainment.—I was glad to see you coming up
the street.” He poured wine. “Here’s to the Eagle
and freedom!—Has England changed to your
eyes?”</p>

<p>“Yes and no,” said Aderhold.</p>

<p>Bow bells were ringing. The sunlight suddenly
flooded the room. Without the door the mate’s
rumbling voice was heard. “Two castaways—”</p>

<p>“I have been gone a year,” said the agent. “The
man that I am looking for is a coming man in England,
and I expect to learn from him—”</p>

<p>The agent and Aderhold were standing by the
table, but Joan had seated herself where through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
open casement she could see the clearing sky. The
movement brought her into the shaft of light. It
bathed, it etherealized face and form. She looked
an immortal.... Placed so, she came first before the
eye when the man, whose step was now heard without,
swung the door wider and entered the room.</p>

<p>The agent started from the table. “Ha, Harry
Carthew! I looked to find you—”</p>

<p>But Carthew had neither eye nor ear for the returned
acquaintance and fellow-resister of the King.
Harry Carthew stood like a man turned to stone....
Six years alone could not have made him look so
much older. He looked much older—a stern and
worn man, with a grim mouth and eyes where enthusiasm
now burned bright and now sank among the
embers of itself. He was dressed much as he used to
dress. It was the face and figure of the man who had
come to Heron’s cottage, but there had been a long
warfare in the nature and some degree of change. He
stood starkly silent, with a great, arrested look, as if
the very elements of his being stood still.... Joan,
rising, passed from the beam of light into the shadow
by Aderhold. They stood side by side, hand touching
hand. With a final crash and clangour the bells
stopped ringing.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded the agent. “You know
these people—”</p>

<p>Carthew moistened his lips. They parted, but at
first there came forth only an uncertain and broken
sound. Then,—“You were long sought. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
the Silver Queen came back from Virginia we learned
that you had escaped upon her, but had been thrown
from her for what you were, and were dead. Years
ago ... and you stand there....”</p>

<p>The mate of the Eagle came to the door. “Sir,
may we be going now?”</p>

<p>The agent crossed to him. “Not yet. Wait a
little, there without—” A voice spoke from behind
the mate. “I am with Master Carthew. I may
enter, sir?”</p>

<p>The agent turned back into the room, and with
him came a slight man with a steeple-crowned hat
and a Geneva cloak. Joan and Aderhold faced
Master Thomas Clement.</p>

<p>At last there came from the minister’s lips,
“Thou witch! Thou atheist and sorcerer!”</p>

<p>The agent of the Company struck his hand against
the table. “Who are these?”</p>

<p>Harry Carthew turned and walked stiffly to the
window-seat. When he reached it he sank down,
rested his locked arms against the sill, and his forehead
upon his arms. But Master Clement was of
more iron make. His long forefinger shot out toward
the two; he raised his arms, the black cloak falling
away from them, his small figure dilated; he shook
his lean and nervous hands; his voice, beginning on a
low tone, grew shrill and rapid; his eyes burned.
Zeal for the honour of his God had him.</p>

<p>“Who are they? Scorners of God and deniers of
Revelation! Yoke-fellows with Satan and blaspheming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
workers and doers of evil! Who are they?
Breakers forth from prison and just doom—cheaters
of stake and gallows—froth of hell! Who are
they? Say not that you have forgotten the
Hawthorn trials!”</p>

<p>“The Hawthorn trials!”</p>

<p>“Who in England heard not of them? Of the
wicked certain ones were hanged, but there broke
gaol and escaped the unbeliever and sorcerer Gilbert
Aderhold and the witch Joan Heron!” He stretched
his arms higher, he shook his hands more vehemently.
“But God for his glory,” he said, “bringeth
them back!”</p>

<p>Aderhold and Joan stood straight and silent. The
shock of the encounter had driven the colour from
cheek and lip, but there was no other sign of cowing.
They knew now that they were in the arms of death.
The knowledge did not frighten. This very day they
had taken their direction—they were moving now
as they had determined.... The agent leaned
against the table, pale and staring.</p>

<p>Aderhold turned and spoke to him. “Our names
are Joan Heron and Gilbert Aderhold. We are not
witch and sorcerer—nor yoke-fellows with Satan—nor
blasphemers of good. But we were judged
by our neighbours and by the law to be such, and
we were condemned to death and put in prison. By
the help of a gaoler who is dead we escaped. We
managed to stow ourselves upon the Silver Queen.
In the seas near the island where the Eagle found us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
our names were discovered and the Silver Queen
cast us adrift. By this fortune and by that we came
first to a larger island and then to the islet from
which the Eagle took us. That, so far as is needful
to tell you, is our story. You have been good to us,
knowing only what we showed. If you will believe,
what we showed was ourselves.”</p>

<p>Joan’s voice, a rich, clear, low voice, followed his.
“I am no witch, and he is no sorcerer. I was a country
girl and he a physician who helped many. Now
we are a man and woman who fare forward, wishing
no ill to any.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she moved, unconsciously, a step
nearer to the table. The agent of the Company
recoiled, put out his hand against her closer approach.
In his face was a white horror. He remembered
the Hawthorn witch trial. That year he had
chanced to be in company with the elder Carthew,
and no detail but had been given him. The very
words of a ballad made upon the witch Joan Heron
came into mind—forgotten, he might have thought,
long since, but now flashing out in letters of fire—hell
fire. It had been a ballad sold and bought
throughout England, and it spared no strange assertion,
nor none that was gross. <i>The Witch Joan Heron.</i>
The ballad rang in his ears. He saw its title. THE
ABHORRED WITCH; or, THE MONSTROUS
LIFE OF JOAN HERON.... A look of sickness
passed over the agent’s face, no longer ruddy. He put
his arm above his eyes. “Avaunt, witch!” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>Joan stepped back. Her eyes sought Aderhold’s.
He bent toward her, took her hands. She smiled
and said in the Indian tongue they had learned upon
that island. “Heart of my heart! The great sea is
cold at first—”</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Master Clement. “She speaks the
tongue she learned of Apollyon!”</p>

<p>Harry Carthew rose from the window-seat. His
face was yet without colour, drawn and sunken, grim
and set. For the most part, with an iron effort, he
kept his voice under control, but now it broke and
sank and now it took a cadence of pain and horror.
He leaned against the wall for support, and once or
twice he lifted his eyes to where, in his thought,
there sat God whom he had angered. “Master
Clement, and my friend here,” he said, “God knows
I cannot doubt that this man is a sorcerer and this
woman a witch! In his Bible God tells us that there
are such and commands that they be done to death.
Moreover, from old time, wise judges and men of
law and knowledge, and devout and holy preachers
of the Word have showed us how these wicked
abound! As for these two, all manner of witness was
brought against them, and proof irrefragable. Yea,
and those who were hanged confessed that these
two kept by day and by night companionship with
Satan and did monstrous wickednesses. And that
the man is an apostate and blasphemer, an atheist
worthy of death, has been proved—nay, he himself
denied nothing in that sort. All that, and the doom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
pronounced against them, in this world and in the
next, stands for true and lasting, and I have no
part in it, and there the shadow comes not against
me.... But there is a sin upon my soul, and God
gives me no rest until I tell it—” He wheeled
toward Master Clement. “I will tell it here and
now, and appoint me a day and I will tell it in open
church—So may offended God pardon me!”</p>

<p>“Harry Carthew! Harry Carthew!” cried Master
Clement. “Every man alive has sin against his soul!
The soul of every man alive is black as midnight,
and no dawn cometh to it save from one that is not
himself! Unless and save the dayspring chooseth to
shine upon that soul, it resteth black and lost—it
hath in itself no power of motion and light! But
God hath elected thee, Harry Carthew! But this
man and woman are of the deep gulf of hell, predestined
and damned of eternity! What have you to
do with them, my brother, my son—for Christ
knoweth I love thee as a son—”</p>

<p>“What had I to do with them?” said Carthew.
“I will tell you! At the trial in the town I gave evidence
that he struck me in the side with a dagger
that eve upon his road to prison. I lied. Sorcerer
and atheist though he be, he told truth when he said
that he did not so. And witch though she be, this
woman told truth when there in the court she cried
out against me. She told truth when she cried that
that night I had come to her cottage to tempt her
and that she struck me with a hunting-knife....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
What was I? I was a young man, mad for a fair
woman—fair as her mother Eve who sinned before
her! What was I? I was a man desirous to increase
in name and fame, desirous of leadership—who
therefore must not let men view his sin! But it was
sin, and I know not if there be a greater—”</p>

<p>If he began as to a more general audience, he
ended with a haggard-eyed appeal to Master Clement....
The minister’s frame trembled; with a pale
and scared face he fronted Harry Carthew whom
he truly loved. “Harry Carthew! Harry Carthew!
Pray to God—”</p>

<p>“I pray,” said Carthew. “Night and day, I
wrestle in prayer. I thought that He had answered
and given me peace in service. The moment I
ceased to serve and to act for this England, that
moment Gehenna opened in my soul.... But now
I see that He wanteth open confession.” He turned
upon the two where they stood beyond the shaft of
light. “Joan Heron, I wronged you,—and Gilbert
Aderhold, I wronged you,—and that I must say,
though you be the Fiend’s own! I must say it,
though I stood in heaven and looked across the gulf
upon you in hell—” He sank upon a bench by
the table and flung his clasped hands above his
head. “God, God! Grant me but to save my soul
alive!”</p>

<p>Silence held in the room at the Hour-Glass. The
agent of the Company leaned against the table,
white and shaken. Master Clement came to Carthew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
put his hand on his shoulder, and spoke in a
trembling voice. “A great sin verily, and greatly
to be repented.... But not the great sin, Harry
Carthew—not the Unpardonable Sin.... God
will have mercy. He will forgive. Have you not
served Him well, and will you not do so, ever the
more zealously? And will you not forever more
guard your ways, that you fall not again into the
pit? I trow that you will! Harry Carthew—Harry
Carthew, we will pray together! You are too valuable—This
very night I will come, and on our
knees we will wrestle with Him as did Jacob of
old—”</p>

<p>Joan and Aderhold stood hand in hand. What
now they felt and thought was simple and whole.
This room with its occupants seemed not to have
over-greatly to do with them—it had widened out—they
felt a larger world.... It was as though
these old quarrels were childish concerns and fears
and quarrels—small, intense, unknowing things—childish,
pitiful. They felt them so, and yet they
did not feel old, they felt young....</p>

<p>Aderhold spoke, again to the agent of the Company.
“Knowing nothing of our story, save that we
were shipwrecked folk, you showed us much kindness.
It does not hurt to take the thanks of shipwrecked
folk. Believe that we are grateful for
that kindness. This is to end, we know, in giving us
into the hands of the law. Then let them call those
who will take us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>Carthew rose from the seat where he had thrown
himself. What wild emotion had possessed and
actuated him was driven to cover and stillness. His
face was grey, but set and grim with no softening
in its lines. He would have said that softening were
further sin. Out like a burned candle had gone long
since his passion for Joan Heron that had never been
high love.</p>

<p>His eyes met those of Master Clement, “Aye,”
he said, “end it!”</p>

<p>Master Clement nodded, turned, and left the
room.</p>

<p>There was, it seemed, no great distance to send,
and those sent for were not long in coming. Without
the Hour-Glass it was now bright afternoon and
many people going up and down. Whenever and
wherever watch or ward was summoned the act of
its summoning was apt immediately to become
known. It was so here and now, and a crowd began
to gather before the Hour-Glass. How there started
a whisper of heinous crime, of escaped and retaken
caitiffs, it were hard to say. Perhaps the host or the
now staring and greatly excited mate of the Eagle
had heard somewhat and had repeated what he had
heard. But there started a murmur which grew to a
buzzing sound and threatened to become clamour.
“What was done?—Who is it? Ho, there, Hour-Glass!
What happened?” The law appeared—half
a dozen burly armed men with an officer at their
head. “Within the Hour-Glass! Let us pass, good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
people, let us pass!” They entered the tavern.
Outside the crowd and the noise grew. “Traitors?”
cried one, and another, “Poisoners?” but a third,
“I can see through the window. It’s a woman—<i>Witch!
Witch!</i>”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="pch">A JOURNEY</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">They</span> lay for a month in prison in London. Then,
all procedures having been met, the law would
return them to the county where they had offended
and the gaol from which they had broken and the
gallows field which had waited six years.</p>

<p>They rode from London in company of a sheriff and
a dozen horsemen, and they went by the road which
Aderhold had travelled years before. He recognised
this place and that. Where the ways were bad—and
they were often bad—they dismounted and
went afoot. So many were with them and so no danger
at all was there of escape, that they were left
unshackled, were even let to draw a little to themselves.
At first the guard was rough of tongue, ready
with frequent, unneeded commands, ready with
coarse gibes. But the two answered quietly, or were
silent without sullenness, and there was something
in them that gave check.... At last the men conveyed
them without insult, without much further
speech to them direct. At night, when they came to
town or village, they were lodged in the gaol. When
they passed where there were people, and if it became
known what manner of felons were here, they
met with savage jeers and execrations. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
mud was thrown, sometimes flints. But it was not
the guard’s cue to tell names and offence—and England
was not as populous then as now—and there
were long miles of lonely peace. To Joan and Aderhold
they seemed at times miles of a beautiful, a
sunny peace. They knew how to talk together with
few words, with a glance of the eye. And there were
many times when, some space allowed them and the
guards talking among themselves, the road became
as it were their own. Then they spoke freely, though
with low voices.</p>

<p>It was late summer, with autumn well in view
upon the slope of the year. The landscape was growing
russet, and none the less fair for that. And it
was England—England after the blue plains of the
sea and the low, coral isles. And it was country and
pure air after the fetid London prison. And it was
the land where they were born—it was home, seen
after years away. These green fields and spreading
trees—this English sky—these birds and flowers
and crystal streams—these were no foes of theirs.
These had never cast them out. Here as elsewhere,
the great round earth had its own orthodoxy, but
took scant heed of man’s.... They saw England
after long absence; and for all that they were to be
slain here, they could find it beautiful, and for all
that they knew where ended this road, they played
with the happenings upon it.</p>

<p>Twenty miles out from London the sheriff’s horse
cast a shoe, and at the next smithy all must halt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
until Grey Dick was shod. The smithy stood in the
pleasant shadow of an oak so great that it must
have been growing when the Conqueror came over.
The hot smithy fire glowed within, iron struck
rhythmically against iron. Beyond the tree was a
well, and all were thirsty. They had not drawn
bridle for several hours. The men dismounted—the
two prisoners were given leave to do likewise,
even to rest upon the earth beneath the oak.</p>

<p>The four children of the smith sat upon a log and
watched with an intensity of interest horses and
men and all their movements, and the man and
woman half sitting, half lying beneath the oak. The
smithy dog came up to these two, snuffed around
them, and then lay down at their feet. <i>Clink!
Clink!</i> and the trees began to wave in an afternoon
breeze, and the voices of the men about the well and
the smithy door sounded cheerful and hardy. The
two had no misliking for the bright world. They
sat watching the children.... The youngest child,
a yellow-haired mite of three, would make an
excursion of its own from the log, past the oak, to
the door. In the course of the journey it came upon
a protruding root, stumbled over it and fell. Joan
sprang forward and lifted it to its feet. “There,
there! You’re not hurt—Look at the pretty flower
you fell against!” The child decided not to cry,
laughed instead. Joan’s arm curved about the sturdy
small form and pressed it to her. “Ah, what a good
baby!”—The child was willing to stay and play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
but with suddenness found herself released, given a
gentle push back toward the three upon the log.
Joan took her seat again upon the turf. “It wasn’t
wise to touch her. It’s strange that it should be so,
but if any saw they might bring it against her when
she is grown.”</p>

<p>She spoke without any pain for herself in her
voice, but with yearning and tenderness for the
child. “Now she’s there and happy! She’s got a
stick to play with.”</p>

<p>“Joan, Joan!” said Aderhold. “There will come
a day—”</p>

<p>The horse was shod, the well-water drunk, guard
and prisoners took again the road. The smith and
his man had, at the last, their curiosity satisfied.
“Witches and wizards!—Nay, if I had known
that—”</p>

<p>The road presented its stream, here full, here very
thin, of autumn travel. Little pictures and the
whole picture had a clear, a vivid interest. Market
people went by, drovers with cattle, sturdy beggars,
children, country girls and swains, carters and their
carts, mounted travel of merchants or justices or
churchmen or country gentlemen. The mounted
travel would always, authoritatively, have its curiosity
gratified. “A ward with prisoners!—Who are
your prisoners, sheriff?” The second morning it was
a party of young gallants who would know this.
They wore feathered hats, fine riding-clothes, boots
of soft leather, their hair somewhat long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
curled. They were for King and Church—would
all live, perhaps, to fight on that side. “Prisoners!
What are your prisoners, sirrah!” Then, when they
knew,—“Witch! Witch! A young witch, too!
Let’s see her—Zounds! Who’s the man?... The
Hawthorn two who fled! <i>Gilbert Aderhold—Joan
Heron!</i>” Certain of these gallants had been in
London and knew of the recapture. It had been
common talk. The king had learned of it. “Joan
Heron!—Joan Heron! Let’s see—let’s see! Grey
eyes—gold hair—no, hair like bronze, pale
bronze.... Would you dare to kiss a witch?”—“No!”—“Yes!”—“No!”—“Yes,
I would!”—“To
make the Devil jealous—that were a parlous
thing!”—“Parlous or not, if she hath grey eyes
and red lips—”—“Kiss her—clip her in thy
arms and to-night she will come as <i>succuba</i> and kiss
and clip thee! Then hark to thy roar, ‘Avaunt, thou
hag! Will none save me from the foul fiend?’”—“Joan
Heron! Rememberest the ballad, THE
DEVIL AND JOAN HERON?”—“But thou’rt
not called ‘Daredevil’ for naught!”—“Do you
dare me?”—“Yes, yes! We dare you!”—“Kiss
her hard, clip her fast—No, no. Master Sheriff!
Fair play—make a ring!... Now! Now!”...
“<i>Well, thou hast courage!</i>”... “<i>She did not struggle,—as
do honest women or those who would be
thought honest!</i>” “To-night, to-night, when thou
hast put out the light, look to find her!”—“Ha,
ha! ha, ha! JOAN HERON—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>They won away from those of the feathered hats.
Space widened between the two cavalcades, the
voices of the gallants died from the ear. The road
lay bright and sunny, the morning air blew fresh and
sweet. The great earth swept calm to the horizon,
the sky sprang, a pure and cloudless arch. For a
long way the road ran lonely of travellers other than
the sheriff, his men, and the prisoners. Joan and
Aderhold, riding together, talked in low tones.
After a time they were passing through a forest.
They loved the brown earth and the bracken, the
boughs overhead, the purple distances.</p>

<p>“I remember this wood,” said Aderhold. “I lay
and rested under these trees and wondered what was
before me.... And I could not see <i>thee</i>.—I did
not know the lovely thing that was before me.”</p>

<p>“And that night, at home, I slept and dreamed—and
saw not thee.”</p>

<p>“There are glories in our lives. With every pain
and sorrow counted in, we have not been unhappy.”</p>

<p>“No. Pain did not win. And the light was
brighter yesterday than the day before, and brighter
to-day than yesterday.... Look at the bird flying
up!”</p>

<p>The third night the troop did not arrive, in time
for rest, at any town or village. A heavy rain had
fallen and delayed progress. They came at dark
to three or four mean houses, clustered around one
of better proportions, an inn by the sign just made
out through the dusk and the autumn mists. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
was not much to eat, but it might be made to do—straw
could be shaken down—there was a great
fireplace where blazing warmth might be had....
To Joan and Aderhold, accustomed to the sun, good
was this warmth! There was one great stone-flagged
room, large as a baron’s hall. When the
dozen men of their guard disposed themselves, there
was yet space where the ruddy glow might reach
them, dry their clothing wet with the rain, warm
their bodies. Where there was not overmuch for any,
their portion of supper was small, indeed, but it
sufficed. When all would sleep, lying about the fire
upon the straw which the inn’s servitors brought in,
the two were thrust to a corner at the far end of the
place, farthest from the door. A watch was set—a
stanch man relieved each two hours by another.
The sheriff meant no slipping of the wizard and
witch out of his fingers. But sleeping time was not
yet come. The two sat to one side, watched, but no
more closely than was thought necessary.</p>

<p>Beside the sheriff and his men there were the host
and hostess, three or four uncouth serving-men and
maids, and one other traveller, belated like the rest.
This was a gentle-faced old man, the parson, it was
learned, of a parish a dozen miles away.... The
night before, in a town of fair size, the names of his
prisoners becoming known, the sheriff had had
trouble to rescue them from the mob that gathered.
This day, therefore, he would keep secret the full
heinousness of the pair—along the way and here it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
was said only that they were a man and woman
accused of witchcraft and apostasy, being transferred
from one gaol to another.</p>

<p>Under this description the inn folk looked aside at
them with great curiosity and fear. At supper time
none could be found willing to carry to them from
the kitchen their bit of coarse bread and pitcher of
water. The host was busied elsewhere; the hostess
put down her foot that she would not; the men and
maids laughed vacantly and stared, but would not
budge in that direction. The old man, the parson,
who chanced to be by, uttered a word of gentle
chiding, then, as all still hung back, himself picked
up the bread and water and carried them to the two.
They thanked him. He stood looking at them with
a gentle, pained face. Called to supper at the long
table where the sheriff and his men were noisily taking
places, he went away. But presently, his own
frugal meal quickly made, he came back. Theirs,
too, was made. They were seated on the stone flooring,
shoulder against the wall, hand touching hand.
They had no look of wicked folk.</p>

<p>The old man found a stool, brought it and sat
down beside them. “You look worn and tired. The
roads have been bad to-day.”</p>

<p>He spoke to Joan. “Bad here and there,” she
said. “We are a little tired.”</p>

<p>The old man sat looking from one to the other.
Then he spoke with simplicity. “Is it true that you
are apostates from religion?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>“What,” said Aderhold, “is religion?—Is it love
of good? Then, with our hand in death’s, I dare aver
that we are not apostates!” He smiled at the old
man. “Since we entered this room you have shown
us a piece of religion.”</p>

<p>“I would show you truly,” said the old man earnestly.
“I would show you Jesus.”</p>

<p>Aderhold answered gently. “You do so, sir. Believe
that all of us know Jesus when we meet him.”</p>

<p>The old man looked from one to the other. “You
do not seem to me wicked people. I know not how
it is, but you seem—” The sheriff and his men
rose noisily from table. There immediately ensued a
bustle in the place—boards and trestles being taken
away—bundles of straw brought in—men going
forth to look after the horses—men coming in with
the breath of the wet night. One came and called
the old parson, drew him away toward the small
inner room where he was to rest. Going, he said
but one word more to the two. “Good-night. I
wish you good sleep.”</p>

<p>The host who had called him held up his hands.
“Reverend sir, I marvel how you can stand to talk
with such miscreants—”</p>

<p>Joan and Aderhold lay upon the stone floor and
slept.... Night passed, the rain ceased, the clouds
broke, dawn came with magnificence. The old parson,
approaching, too, in the course of nature, his
death hour, slept on like a child in the inner room.
But Joan and Aderhold went forward with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
guard. The inn sank from sight, the road stretched
before them.</p>

<p>This day, riding into a village, they found there,
the centre until their arrival of excited interest, no
less a matter than an officer of the law with three or
four subordinates, come from the town to which
they were bound—despatched thence by the authorities
with orders to meet upon the way the party
known to be bringing from London that witch and
sorcerer, join themselves to it, and so give touch
of that town and county’s importance, assuming
charge, as it were, even leagues away, of their own
sinful ones.... Aderhold and Joan recognized the
head figure—across the years they saw him again
at the Hawthorn trials—a tall, lean, saturnine
minor piece of the law’s machinery who had herded
the prisoners in and out of that hall of judgement.
He was so tall and lean and lantern-jawed and grim
that he might have been a prize man for the rôle of
Death in a mystery play. For his part he came and
looked at them, threw back his head and laughed.
“Ha, ha!” he said. “We’ve got you back! The
wicked do not prosper!” With that he returned to
the sheriff with whom he would ride.... This village
was of the places where stones and other matters
were flung, together with whatever epithet came
to the lips. Joan and Aderhold opposed a quietness.
Both were bleeding when at last the law persuaded
or threatened down the raised hands and bore them
away for its own blows. Out even upon the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
road came, borne by the wind, “Witch—Witch—Witch!
Vile Witch!”</p>

<p>There was a man with the added party who
proved to be of kin to the Hawthorn end of the
county. He knew Hawthorn and Hawthorn Forest.
Riding near to the two prisoners and discoursing
with his fellows, the two heard mention of many a
familiar name. He had a body of great bulk and a
round, good-humoured face, and a liking for his own
speech which he delivered—so as not to disturb his
superiors—in a monotone of low pitch. The two
heard him talk of the Hawthorn crops and fields and
weather, of the times good and bad, of the stock, the
sheep and cattle, of the streams and woods, of the
people.... This day was a high, cool autumn day
with a tang in the air. The sun shone, but there was
a wind and whirling leaves. Joan and Aderhold
knew that now there were not many miles.... At
dusk they halted within a hamlet where the folk
were too few to do more than stare and talk. There
was no gaol. The two were thrust into a damp and
dark place where firewood was piled. Bread and
water were given them, but no straw for sleeping
upon. When the heavy door was shut and barred,
and those without and the hamlet’s self sunk into
sleep or silence, all was as black, as cold and still, as
the grave is supposed to be.</p>

<p>The two knew that next day they would reach
the town and the prison from which, six years and
more ago, they had fled away. There they would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
separated.... Probably they would die together—would
be brought forth together to die—might
then each reach the other’s hand, might clasp it until
nearly the last. But not again in this life would they
be together like this, alone together, free, shut from
the world.... To-night, at first, all things flowed
away save the fact that they loved, save human
passion and sorrow and clinging. They lay in the
space left by the heaped firewood, in the intense
dark, and they held each other in their arms, close,
close! as if to defy all parting, and there were broken
words and sighs and tears. The last night—the
last night—</p>

<p>The higher mood returned, though slowly, slowly.
With the bending of the night toward dawn, it was
here. They lay with clasped hands, and when they
spoke they spoke of love. All things else flowed
away, or did not flow away, for it was now as though
love tinted all, made the vast whole warm and vital....
They spoke of their child, and of their island life
and home; they spoke of the old chief. They spoke of
people they had known and loved—of old Roger
Heron, of Master Hardwick—of many, of all people.
The draff and dross, the crooked and bent, all
came into the glow, the solvent. Love—love—love!...
Love took this form and took that form,
and now it flew with these wings, and now with other
wings—and it was love of the body and the earth
and all nature, and it was love of wisdom—love of
knowledge—love of the search—love of love—love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
of truth! It was love that was not afraid—that
rose on splendid wings—that outwatched the night
and saw the morning coming....</p>

<p>Outside began, faintly, a stirring. A cock crew
and was answered. A dog barked—the cock-crow
came again. A grey light stole in at the keyhole and
under the door of the windowless place they were in.
It strengthened until they could make out each
other’s face and form. The dog barked again, men’s
voices were heard.</p>

<p>Joan and Aderhold rose to their knees, to their
feet, steadying each other, holding by the firewood.
The place, through the night, had had the chill of
the sepulchre. They knew it to be their last moment
together; hereafter, to the end, there would be others
by. They stood locked in each other’s arms, their
lips meeting.... Steps were heard without and the
fall of the chain from across the door. They released
each other, they stood apart. The door swung open,
light rushed in. “Come forth, you wicked ones!
Time to ride on—and to-night we’ll lodge you in
the nest you flew from!”</p>

<p>There could not have been a fairer autumn day.
And now as they rode the country grew more and
more familiar.... While the day was yet young,
all were halted for a few minutes before a tavern set
among trees, its sign a great rose painted on a black
ground. While ale in jacks and tankards was brought
forth for the guardians of the law, the two prisoners
had brief speech together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Rose Tavern,” said Aderhold. “It was in
this place that I first met Master Hardwick. It was
here that came the turn toward Hawthorn.”</p>

<p>“We have not far to go now.”</p>

<p>“No, not far.”</p>

<p>In the doorway stood the tall hostess that Aderhold
remembered. She stood with arms akimbo, regarding
the prisoners with a mien so hostile as to approach
the ferocious. “Aaah!” she said. “I’d like
to help bring straw and wood!” She spat toward the
two. “Haven’t <i>I</i> had things bewitched?—a gold
earring taken from under my eyes, and our ricks
burned, and ill luck for a year running—and a bat
this summer came flapping through the house every
eve, and none could beat it down!” She was speaking
to the constable’s man who knew Hawthorn.
“Wherever that vile witch has been this weary time,
be sure she’s sent her word out over all these parts
to do us harm—”</p>

<p>“And that’s very possible,” said the round-faced
man.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to take them by Hawthorn?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the other. “Turn off this side
of town—go round by Hawthorn Wood—then
through Hawthorn, and so back to town and the
prison. It’s miles out, but Hawthorn wants it done.
There’s a murmur of more witches—and it’s good
warning to see how such folk fare!”</p>

<p>Joan and Aderhold, startled, exchanged glances.
They had not thought of that—of coming to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
prison from the Hawthorn end. They would be
longer together. Joan’s lips parted. “And Hawthorn
Forest—Ah, maybe we shall see Heron’s
cottage—”</p>

<p>The sun and shadow on the road, the waving
trees, the white fleets of clouds in a blue, blue sky....
They came to the crossroads with the suicide’s
grave—they came to the rise of earth where stood
the gibbet with its swinging chains—they came to
a view of the castle wood and the castle and the town
beyond. One of the men asked a question of the
round-faced man. “Who lives up there?”</p>

<p>“The earl,” said the round-faced man. “But he’s
away now. It used to be that if he wasn’t there his
cousin, Sir Richard, was. But Sir Richard went to
France, and they say he married there and has a son.—I
used to know Gervaise his man. But Gervaise
has gone too.”</p>

<p>The sun made of the castle woods golden woods.
Joan could see the Black Tower—see where deep
among the trees would be the huntsman’s house.
A great bird rose above the gold-green and sailed
away.... Here, a mile from the first outlying house,
was the narrow and little-used road that, curving
aside from the town, led through some miles of country,
tilled and untilled, to Hawthorn Forest; then,
with a half turn, came at its leisure to Hawthorn,
and so touched again the highway. They took this
road.</p>

<p>Until they came to a stream, in size between a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
brook and a river, the country was to the two as the
other familiar country. But this was the stream
that murmured past the Oak Grange. They were
riding by its shore, they were going toward the
Grange—now indeed it grew to be known land.
Aderhold knew every winding.... The two rode as
in a dream. Before them, in the distance, in a golden
haze, rose a forest. “Hawthorn Wood”—and
Joan’s voice made the words dreamy music. The
sun was warm now, the sky was blue, the leaves were
falling, but without sadness, ready to go, to return
once more to the elements, build again. The stream
bent and the road with it. There came a long reach
of murmuring water, sliding by a pebbly strand.
Across it now were fields that once had gone with
the Oak Grange.... A little farther, and they saw
the old house, and before it the fairy oak.</p>

<p>Just at the footbridge across the stream sounded
an order to halt. The lean, grim man whom the town
had sent spoke in a harsh and rattling voice. “This
is where he made gold and practised sorcery.—Thou
God-denier! behold thy old lair, how accursed
it looks!”</p>

<p>To the two it did not seem accursed. It stood an
old, deserted, ruinous house, but the ivy was green
upon it, and the sunshine bathed it, and the swallows
circled above the roof. The oak tree in front
lived, and from its acorns were growing other oaks....
Joan and Aderhold looked long and earnestly.
The air was thronged with memories and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
seemed a weaving music. They were not unhappy—the
artifex within them was not unhappy. But
those that were with them thought that they must
be so.</p>

<p>The horses were in motion again. And now the
road turned and became Hawthorn Forest road that
ran to Hawthorn. The Oak Grange passed from
sight, the murmur of the stream left the ears. They
were within Hawthorn Forest. The great trees rose
around; there fell gold shafts of light; there came the
odour, damp and rich, of the forest mould deepening,
deepening since old time. Down a purple vista
they saw deer moving—a faint wind was blowing—there
was a drifting, drifting down of leaves....
To Joan and Aderhold this forest breathed music.
They were glad to be here once again. They knew
the single trees and the groups of trees, they knew
each picture within a picture: loved the detail and
loved the whole. It was sweet, before death, to have
been in Hawthorn Wood again.</p>

<p>Heron’s cottage. When they were forth from the
forest they would see that plainly, riding by. Perhaps
they would draw rein there too. The red crept
into Joan’s cheek, her grey eyes grew bright and
wistful.... The forest stopped; the grassy road
brought them out into full sunshine, a high blue sky
arching the open, autumn country. Heron’s cottage....
There was yet the green path from the road,
yet the fruit trees, bronze now and trembling in the
wind—but there was no thatched cottage. “Vile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
witch!” said the tall man, “Hawthorn burned your
house.”</p>

<p>Hawthorn—there was no great distance now to
Hawthorn. There had never been much passing
on this road, little human life going up and down.
This day there seemed none; moreover, a cot or two
by the wayside showed no folk about the doors, appeared
shut and left to care for themselves. At dawn
a man had been sent forward on a fresh horse—the
loneliness of the road now connected itself with that.
“Everybody’s gone to Hawthorn,” said the round-faced
man.</p>

<p>Hawthorn Church, stone amid stone-like yew
trees, Hawthorn roofs showed over the rim of the
fields. Out of a coppice rose a lark and soaring high
sang up there in the blue. The Hawthorn Forest
road joined the highroad; guard and prisoners coming
upon this turned now to Hawthorn village. Carthew
House—they passed Carthew House—they
passed the outlying cottages, among them that of
Alison Inch—they came into Hawthorn and to
Hawthorn Church and Master Clement’s house.
Here were the people....</p>

<p>A bench had been placed by the churchyard gate,
and upon this stood Master Clement, raised as by a
pulpit over Hawthorn. Near him stood Squire
Carthew and his brother, and the latter stood grim
and grey as granite. It was his intention to rise in
church the coming Sunday and before all Hawthorn
acknowledge that six-years-past sin. He owed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
to God. The confession might or might not put in
jeopardy his future in England, but, however that
might be, he would make it—make it publicly!
So he might have peace and could go on with the
great work, assured that God had forgiven....
For to-day he had made himself come hither, taking
it as part of his duty. Master Clement had urged
that it was his duty. With a stern face he gazed upon
the two, but they, after one glance, looked at him
no more.</p>

<p>All around, packed in the churchyard and the
street, were the people of Hawthorn and its neighbourhood.
How many familiar faces they saw—but
how few out of which superstition had not
razed kindliness! Heretofore on this journey, where
they had been set in the eye of a gathered crowd,
the two had met with physical blows no less than
with hard words. But the Hawthorn throng was
held in hand. No stone or clod or refuse was
thrown. The hard words arose, broke over them
heavily, a sordid and bitter wave. But this, too, the
minister checked. He raised his arms and flung them
wide, he shook his lean and nervous hands. Thrust
to the front of the throng stood the tinker with
whom Joan had once walked on the road from the
town. “Hist, hist!” said the tinker. “Now will
they hear their last sermon!”</p>

<p>“‘<i>And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and
death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them,
and they were judged according to their works....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
And whosoever was not found written in the book of
life was cast into the lake of fire!</i>’</p>

<p>“‘<i>And the devil that deceived them was cast into the
lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false
prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever
and ever.</i>’”</p>

<p>Hawthorn drew in its breath and shivered with
that sermon. They said that it was the greatest that
Master Clement had ever preached, and he had
preached a-many great ones! Some of the simpler
folk almost looked for fire to come down from heaven
and consume the wicked leech and that vilest witch
where they stood. It would have been a wonderful
sight and lesson! But doubtless God wanted the
forms of the law carried out—though they could
not but still think how wonderful would have been
a visible sign....</p>

<p>Joan and Aderhold were an hour in Hawthorn....
It passed; all hours passed, though some, and
this among them, went on wounded feet.</p>

<p>It passed. They were in motion again. The
Hawthorn folk that cried bitter words behind them,
the narrow street, the small, familiar houses with
dooryards where the flowers were fading, the ale-house,
the green, the sexton’s house, other houses,
the elms and willows that marked the village end—all
were overpassed, left behind. Here at last was
the open road, and they had six miles to ride together....
Hawthorn faded from the mind.</p>

<p>It was afternoon. The gold light lay softly over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the country that had always seemed to them a very
fair country—that seemed so still. The wind had
fallen. They rode side by side. Those that guarded
them were tired with the long day and its various
excitements. These rode in silence or talked among
themselves in voices somewhat subdued, and for a
time let the prisoners go unmarked. When they
came within sight of the town it would be different.
Then all would straighten in their saddles and
closely surround the two, assuming the proper air of
vigilance. But now they allowed them to ride side
by side and gave no heed to what words they might
speak to each other.</p>

<p>They were simple words that Joan and Aderhold
spoke—old, old words of love and tenderness. They
spoke of courage. And they spoke of Truth, the
Origin and Goal. And they loved each other, and
the light of all suns, and they found song and sweetness,
promise and fulfilment even in this autumnal
day....</p>

<p>The miles fell away like the leaves from the trees.
The ground rose; they had a great view bathed in
the amber light. There flowed a gleaming crescent.
“The river!” said Joan.</p>

<p>The town that they had seen from the south, now
they saw from the north. They saw the river and
the arched bridge, the climbing streets and many
roofs; they saw the great church and near it the dark
prison, and above the town the castle and the castle
wood. The sun was sinking, the light was reddening;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
above, the sky sprang pure, without a stain, for the
fleets of clouds had sailed away.</p>

<p>The tall, lean man spoke. “Witch and blasphemer!
do you see yon ragged field sloping down? That is
where we will hang you.”</p>

<p>Joan and Aderhold, going toward the river, looked
upon the ragged field with steadfastness, but gave
but few moments to that sight. Before them was
the arched bridge, and they saw, even on this side of
it, people gathering. Presently the sheriff’s men
would come between them, surrounding each, making
one go before the other. Now they had these last
few moments side by side. Their hands might touch,
their eyes be eloquent. Farewell—and farewell—and
oh, fare you well, love—my love!...</p>

<p>The road descended to the river and the bridge.
There arose the sound they knew from the crowd
they knew. The sheriff’s men pushed between them;
they must go one before the other. So each might
be better seen as well as better guarded. They
crossed the river; they mounted the steep street;
they came to the town square, past the great church’s
sculptured portal.... The two had been ordered
to dismount, were now afoot.... Here was the
pillory—here was the black prison’s frowning front,
the prison steps, the open door.... The setting
sun flooded the place with red light. A flint, flung
by some strong arm, had cut Aderhold’s forehead.
With his hand he wiped the blood away and looked
to see Joan. She was upon the prison steps, lifted so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
that the roaring crowd might see her. That great
light from the sun beat strongly upon face and form.
The form was drawn to its height, the face was high,
resolved, and beautiful. But the crowd shouted,
“The witch! The witch! Look at the light as of
fire! The fire has her already! Witch—Witch—Witch!”</p>

<p>Joan mounted the last step, the black prison
gaped for her, she entered. Aderhold, mounting,
met also that great shaft of light. The voice of the
crowd swelled, grew phrensied, but he heeded it not,
and with a face lit from within followed Joan into
the prison.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
